This step when known by the audience occasioned much mischief.  Acting the play not allowed.  +General Advertiser=, 22 Nov.: An Address to the Public, +dl Theatre= 20 November.  As the extraordinary disturbances which have lately happened at this theatre greatly affect the diversions of the publick, as well as the property of the manager, he thinks it incumbent on him to justify his conduct by giving a fair statement of the case....The reasons of complaint assigned, he apprehends, are the exhibition of Pantomimes, Advanced Prices, and Insults on the audience--as to the first, he submits it to be considered that however distasteful such pieces may be to the delicacy of some judgments, yet there are others to whose taste they are suited; as the playhouse may be considered as the general mart of pleasure, it is only from the variety of entertainment, the different tastes of the public can be supplied--of this the receipts of the house are a sufficient evidence, it being notorius, how necessary the addition of such pieces is towards procuring the best play a numerous audience.  With regard to the advanced prices, the Manager hoped he should in some measure be justified by the great increase of the charges of the theatre which, notwithstanding any reduction that has been made, are still at least a fourth part greater than usual--but as in this point he has already submitted, he conceives it can no longer remain the subject of their displeasure, especially as by an advertisement handed about the theatre it was said that every objection would cease, when the manager consented to return the advanced prices to those, who did not choose to be tortured with entertainments.  As to insults on the audience...last week upon some persons flinging the sconces and candles on the stage a quarrel arose, in the confusion of which a Gentleman was secured, but by whom the Manager knows not, nor ever gave any order, or was any acquainted with the affair till after he was discharged, for the truth of which he refers to the affidavit annexed.  As to the accusation of several bruisers (as they are termed) being employed on Saturday night to insult Gentlemen, the Manager declares, that there was none but the Peace Officers, Carpenters, and Scene-men (which on account of the Entertainments are very numerous) and other servants belonging to the theatre; nor did they appear till urged by the tumult, by tearing up benches and threat'ning to come on the stage and demolish the scenes; nor could the Manager apprehend this legal precaution to prevent mischief and defend his property would ever be construed as an infringement on the liberty of an audience, especially when it is considered, what great damages he sustained some years ago on an attempt of the like nature--if any such persons appeared in the pit, the Manager presumes, they must have come in with the multitude, after his doorkeepers were drove from their posts, and the house was open to all; which was evident from several hundred persons more being present at the disturbance than were at the performance that night, who then came to a determination to prevent any performance on the Monday.  After this impartial account of his conduct, the manager appeals to the judgment of the publick what foundation he has given for the outrageous disturbance on Monday night; and cannot help thinking, the real injuries he has sustained, too severe a punishment for an imaginary offence, having lost several hundred pounds already, by people being terrified from frequenting the theatre.  A total exclusion is now insisted on, the Manager to resign his property, the Publick to be deprived of their diversions and the players of their subsistence; And all this after every concession, becoming one gentleman to ask, or another to make, has been submitted to.  [Affidavit of Constable followed.  See $Genest=, IV, 139-40.]  The following three pamphlets came out expressing points of view concerning $Fleetwood= and his policy and management: I. +The Disputes between the Director of d.l. and the Pit Potentates=, 20 Nov.  As a Letter to a Friend it tells the resolution: not to have old Pantomimes (so execrably bad that they were damn'd when new) imposed on them, unless the manager would take no more than common prices; reports how Fleetwood stocked the pit with Men of doughty valor...disguised in the habits of Gentlemen, to throw out all who protested; protests the system of casting employed whereby 2nd rate actors appeared in good parts; discusses hardship cases of certain actors ($Mrs Roberts=, $Mrs Horton=, $Mrs Mills=) and asks why $Theophilus Cibber= is not on the stage.  2. +An Impartial Examen of the Present Contests=, by $Mr Neitherside=, 1744: harks back to Fleetwood's finacial policies of the previous year, deploring his relations with the actors and with manager of +cg=; scourges him for miscasting his plays around one prominent actor, rather than giving a balanced performance; deplores his paying Mrs Cibber, $Mrs Clive= so much; revives the 1743 dispute which led to secession; dislikes the casting for 2 Nov. of +Love's Last Shift=; suggests better casts for many plays; scores the +Licensing Act= for reducing players to slavery; hopes for resumption of balanced performances.  3. +Stage Policy Detected, or some Selcet Pieces of Theatrical Secret History Laid Open, in a Letter to a Certain Manager=, 1744: takes apart Fleetwood's Defense, statement by statement, giving him the lie at each point.  Suggests the real money from the house comes from Pit and Box, which are protesting his pantomimes; shows full attendance at +Rehearsal= and +Macbeth= with no afterpieces.

From scheming, pelting, famine, and despair, Behold to grace restored an exil'd Play'r: Your Sanction yet his fortune must compleat, And give him privilege to laugh and eat.  No revolution plots are mine again; You see, thank Heaven, the quietest of men.  I pray that all domestic feuds might cease; And beggar'd by the war, solicit peace; When urg'd by wrongs, and prompted to rebel; I sought for freedom, and for freedom fell; What could support me in the sevenfold dame?  I was no Shadrak and no angel came.  Once warn'd, I meddle not with state affairs; But play my part, retire and say my pray'rs.  Let nobler spirits plan the vast design, Our green-room swarms with longer heads than mine; I take no part-no private jars foment, But hasten from disputes I can't prevent; Attack no rival brother's fame, or ease; And raise no struggle, but who most shall please.  United in oursdlves, by you approv'd.  Tis ours to make the slightest muse belov'd; So may the stage again its use impart, And ripen Virtue, as it warms the heart.  May discord, with her horrid trump, retreat, Nor drive the frighted Beauty from her seat; May no contending parties strive for sway, But judgmemt govern, and the stage obey.  *p€ócg As You Like It.

As I perceived, that joining good Sense and Significant Words of Musick, was the best Method of recommending this to an +English Audience=; I have directed my Studies that way, and endeavour'd to shew, that the English Language, which is so expressive of the sublimest Sentiments, is the best adapted of any to the full and solemn Kind of Musick.  I have the Mortification now to find, that my Labours to please are become ineffectual, when my Expences are considerably greater.  To what Cause I must impute the Loss of the Publick Favour, I am ignorant, but the Loss itself I shall always lament.  In the mean time, I am assur'd that a Nation, whose Characteristic is good Nature, would be affected with the Ruin of any Man, which was owing to his Endeavours to entertain them.  I am likewise persuaded, that I shall have the forgiveness of those noble Persons, who have honour'd me with their Patronage, and their Subscription this Winter, if I beg them Permission to stop short, before my Losses are too great to support, if I proceed no farther in my Undertaking; and if I intreat them to withdraw three Fourths of their Subscription, one Fourth part only of my Proposal having been perform'd.

He is upwards of six feet in height; wdll and prortionably made, treads well and knows what to do with his limbs; in short a noble graceful figure.  I can say nothing of his face but that it was all black, with a wide mough and good eyes.  His voice is of a clear and pleasing tone, something like $Delane='s, but not so deep-mouthed, not so like a passing bell.  When high strain'd it is apt to crack a little and be hoarse, but in its common pitch, and when it sinks into any softer passion, particularly expressive and touching.  In the first scene, especially when he recounts to the +Senate=r the progress of his love and the means he used to win +Desdemona=r, he was quite mistaken, and I took a pique against him; instead of a cool narration he flew into a rant of voice and action, as though he were relating the circumstance of a battle that was fought yesterday.  I expected nothing more from him, but was deceiv'd: in the scenes of rage and jealousy he was seldom inferior to $Quin= in the parts of tenderness and sorrow far above him.  These latter seem to be his peculiarly; his action is not very various, but rarely improper, or without dignity, and some of his attitudes are really fine.  He is not perfect to be sure, but I think may make a better player than any now on the stage in a little while.  However, to see a man in one character, and but once, is not sufficient, so I rather ask your opinion by this, than give you mine.--+Horace Walpole's Correspondence with Thomas Gray=, II, 6-7.  *pƒ¤cg Venice Preserved; or, a Plot Discovered.

To say they are excellent in their way is barely doing 'em justice; but in these Dances they may be said to have excell'd themselves.  The first, tho' a kind of Serious Pastoral Ballet afforded the Audience great Pleasure; and I believe never did three dancers in a Pas Trois, altogether equal the Execution of Sg Salomon, Madem Violette, and Mr Cook; there was an Elegance peculiar to herself that shone thro' her whole performance.  The other Entertainment is the representation of a Fair, to which People of all degrees and nations are suppos'd to resort, it may not improperly be stil'd a very High Piece of Low Humour; and caused as much laughter and applause as the strongest Farce ever produc'd, without offending the Modesty of the Ladies.  We have had many performers from abroad, but Sg Salamon and Violette so inimitably express their characters in this entertainment, that I think they excel what we have hitherto seen; and very much deserve the Encouragement of the Town, I am, &c.  *p„cg The Miser.

In his letter 19 Aug. 1746 (Folger) he wrote]: I had the pleasure of the Doctor's company [brother Benjamin Hoadly] to supper at my lodgings the night before I set out for this place; we talk'd about Ranger, but whether he will appear next winter or sleep forever in ye scritore, is not yet determined: 'tis pit, faith.  [That this friendship was exceedingly profitable to Garrick is indicated by the fact that Benjamin Hoadly seems to have turned over the profits from the three author's nights to Garrick.  (1) Garrick by a bargain with $John Rich= received #80 advance cash and promised to pay nightly charges (3rd, 6th, & 9th nights) of #60, and (2) to divide equally the remaining profits on those nights.  The agreement was drawn 27 Dec. 1746.  Garrick noted on this document]: N.B. the copy of the play is my own, and the profit arising from the printing of it. [Hoadly seems to have received only the #100 given him by +George II= for dedicating the printed copy to him.]  [Settlement for the three performances was made 6 April.  Total receipts for those nights (14, 18, 21 Feb.) was #570 11s.  Total expenses were #182 2s.  (including #2 2s. for the licensing).  The profit of #388 9s. was equally divided and Garrick received his #194 4s. 6d. on that day.  He had received the other #80 the day before the play opened, 11 Feb. 1747.

From +The Museum, or Literary and Historical Register=, No 25, 28 Feb. 1747, p. 382: On the Present State of the Theatre: I remember when you and I were last in Town together, some years ago, we were eternally repining at the wretched condition of the stage.  $Quin= was then at the head of the Fraternity; but a very different man from what he is at present, and merely a bad copy of $Booth=; with all his mouthing and pageantry, but without his musical elocution, or his dignity.  Whether Time or Emulation has had the greatest hand in Improving him, I know not; but certain it is, that he is improved, beyond what you will really imagine.  He has got much more variety, and much more Spirit.  He was always a tolerably just speaker; but then he has hardly anything more; he recited rather than acted....However, $Rich= has...got $Quin=, $Garrick=, $Mrs Cibber= and $Mrs Pritchard= to the new house.  The consequence has been, that the stage was never, in my memory, so fashionable; not even in the Time of $Mrs Oldfield='s highest fame.  A good taste both of acting and of plays themselves, is much more general than I ever expected to have seen it; and those who are skilled in such matters, tell me, that Rich will be a greater gainer this season than has been known for these many years.

Corbett=, over against +St. Dunstan's Church=, +Fleet St.= (+General Advertiser=).  [Illuminating discussion of actors' abilities]: The Stage is much indebted to Mr M- for his incessant successful endeavours; he not only grac'd it with his own personal merits, but rais'd up several Branches who tho' they have not yet quite eclips'd Mr +Giffard's Nursery= from +Goodman's Fields=, will certainly in time prove stars of the first magnitude.--(p. 28).  Touch Messrs. $Giffard= and $Ryan= and give them better voices; there is nothing else wanting.  Help $Mr Delane= to a new manner and judgment to display the best pipe that ever was heard.  Polish a little the rough Beauties of $Mr L. Sparkes=, give the sensible $Mr Havard= a few more spirits; and mend the Humour of $Hippisley=, $Chapman=, $Barrington=, and $Blakes= if you can.  Poor $Yates= wants nothing but a front of brass, a necessary self-sufficient Manner of pushing himself upon a Publick.--(p. 31).  If $Mrs Giffard='s Manner was equal to her understanding, she wou'd compell everybody to acknowledge her a surprising Performer.  In +Lady Macbeth=r she is excellent; and +Hermione=r was very near eclipsing a much more popular actress; in short in every Part she performs, the severest of her enemies cannot but own she is more than decent.--(pp. 32-33).

This itemizes the outstanding liabilities to the amount of #8,808 14s. including #1,275 of arrears in actors' salaries]: I told Mr- the intended purchaser that the whole would not amount to #12,000.  He said if it was more it should rest on me, for that was the utmost shilling he would give.  But upon strict enquiry I find it will amount to #12,808 14s.  This difference is not altogether owing to an error in calculation, but has been likewise heightened by a falling off of business, nor is it possible to ascertain the debt of a theatre for a day, it is of so fluctuating a nature.  Q: whether this loss ought to light upon me, who have endeavored to get a purchaser & increased the value of the Estate to the utmost of my power?  Errors excepted.  [$James Lacy= or $John Powel= are the most likely authors of this statement.  Whatever the authority, it is clear that settlement had not yet been made for transfer of ownership.  For Powel, see $G.

The purity of the English stage was certainly much more fully establish'd during the administration of this theatrical minister than it had ever been during preceding managements; for, what the publick taste had itself to some measure begun, he, by keeping that taste within its proper channel, and feeding it with a pure and untainted stream, seems to have completed; and to have endeavoured as much as possible to adhere to the promise made in the prologue which was spoken at the first opening of that theatre under his direction, @Bade scenic virtue form the rising age@And truth diffuse her radiance from the stage.@  *p…sf The Beggar's Opera.  *a…sf New Pantomime [Entertainment%.

The burden of the author's complaints was: (1) the theatre has been operating for a month yet Garrick has appeared in only one character; (2) that he should buy himself off with speaking a prologue only, then sell that to the public at 6d. shows vanity, avarice, and lack of managerial responsibility; (3) that plays such as +Albumazar= (simple and poorly cast) and +Scornful Lady=, (with irreligious and atheistical parts) should not have been passed off on the public, whose expectations were raised high at the thought of Garrick's management.  $Macklin= even had to apologize to the audience as he played the part of +Sir Roger=r in the latter play.  E. F. closed by urging: "Get up the best of our English Tragedies and Comedies; encourage the rising Wits and be under no apprehesion of the want of success."  If you use common sense in casting your actors, as your former managers did (with all their other faults) in casting you, you will not yourself have to play every night.

He was a Man of pregnant Wit, gay Humour and of excellent Learning; which gain'd him the Esteem of the Polite Part of the Town, and particularly recommended him to the Favour of $Ben Johnson=, who adopted him one of his Sons, and held him in equal Esteem with the ingenious $Mr Cartwright=, another of the Laureat's adopted Sons:--The Plays he wrote were: [he lists 5 plays, commenting from $Cokayne= and $Rich= of +Christ's Church College=, $Oxon=, and $West= on the ethical quality of the last one, +The Muses' Looking Glass=].  In short, Sir, I doubt not but his old nervous Wit will still please, and join'd with the New Masque you have added, excite Curiousity enough to answer your Design; since by your Steadiness it was absoluteley necessary you should hava Novelty, as well as Interest, to procure half so good a House, as we all wish you, and especially, Your Humble Servant, $I.

This charge was also set down that the principle [sic] treasurer should not know to the contrary, because it was told him that Mrs Cibber paid for her benefit, and if he had imagin'd otherwise, he perhaps would have insisted upon the same terms for his wife (Mrs Pr-h-d).

[A column and a half "Letter to the Author" appeared in the +General Advertiser= this day, laying historical background for $Ford='s +Lover's Melancholy=].  The history of the stage before the Restoration is like a Foreign Land, in which no $Englishman= had ever travelled; we know there were such things as Playhouses, and one $Shakespear= a great writer, but the historical traces of them are so imperfect, that the manner in which they existed is less known to us, than that of $Eschylus= or the theatres of +Greece=.  For this reason, 'tis hoped that the following Gleaning of Theatrical History will readily obtain a place in your paper. 'Tis taken from a Pamphlet written in the reign of +Charles I=, with this quaint title, "Old Ben's Light Heart made heavy by young John's +Melancholly Lover="; and as it contains some historical anecdotes and altercations concerning $Ben Johnson=, $Ford=, $Shakespear=, and the +Lover's Melancholy= it is imagined that a few extracts from it at this juncture, will not be unentertaining to the Public.  [The substance of the remainder retails $Jonson='s critical cantankerousness and his wounded pride at the failure of the +New Inn=, quoting some epigrams made at Jonson's expense on his allegation that Ford was a plagiary.  This second "puff" for the play, presumably also written by $Macklin=, formed the basis for a $Steevens=-$Malone= controversy late in the century, centering on the existence or nonexistence of the pamphlet referred to by Macklin as "Old Ben's Light Heart made Heavy, &c."  A summary account of the evidence appears in the +Dramatic Works of John Ford=, by $Henry Weber= (+Edinburgh=, 1811) I, Intro. XVI, XXXI.]  Receipts: #210 ($Cross=); #208 1s.

Sir: When I read the letter in your paper [see 7 Nov.] concerning $Tom Harbin='s intention of having a Benefit at +Covent Garden=, I own I was much pleas'd, as it would give me the opportunity of making him merry, who has often made me so: But I have since been in some concern to hear he was to perform himself--I would not have him appear in an Ill-Light; and as it is easy to conceive what confusion a Man unus'd to the stage must be in, to appear on it, I would in Friendship advise him to desist from that design.-If he does it from an opinion of his Capacity, I am sorry for him: but if it is only to draw people together, I think he need not have any Apprehensions on that Account:--For there ever was and ever will be in +London=, a number of Persons of Fortune and Generosity, sufficient to do what he wants, whenever they have an Inclination to serve a man they like.--And as he is Generally allow'd to be what is call'd a Fiddle in Company, and plays as often as anybody, it would be but right to keep him in tune: For my part I shall use my interest in his Favour and wish him success with his Acquaintance.  I am &c. $T. Meanwell=.  +Lloyd's Coffee House=, 14 Nov.  [See 14 Dec.]  *p†Ïking's La Comedia in Comedia.  See 8 Nov.  *d†Ïking's As 12 Nov.  *p†Ğdl Much Ado about Nothing.

[Suggests he should not be to blame for misbehavior of any person who hired his house, that he had some apprehensions in this case, but that the Bottle Conjurer paid the rent in advance and agreed to have a House officer in the box office to return the money if the audience was displeased.]  All the caution above mentioned was taken, and the money locked up in the office, guarded by persons of reputation, who would have returned it, and publicly on the stage told them, that if the person did not appear, their money should be return'd.  But instead of complying with that offer, my House was pulled down, the Office broken open, the money taken out, and the servants oblig'd to fly to save their lives.

The writer listens to three critics in the pit decry the performance, then after seeing it himself concludes: "It was receiv'd with universal approbation...Upon the whole I dare affirm that the Judgment of Posterity will concur with me in distinguishing +Irene= as the best tragedy which this age has produced, for Sublimity of thought, Harmony of numbers, strength of expression, a scrupulous observation of Dramatic Rules, the sudden Turn of events, the tender and generous distress, the unexpected catastrophe, and the extensive and important moral."  He inquires why the play has not been so favorably received as others, and concludes it is too finely and artistically conceived to please the masses.  He closes by complimenting the Ladies of +Great Britain= for he "scarce ever saw so shining an assembly in the Boxes.  Their early approbation of a Tragedy in which not only the words but the ideas are entirely chaste; a tragedy filled with noble sentiment and poetic beauty is at once a proof of their delicacy and penetration."]  Receipts. #100 ($Cross=); #101 ($Powel=).  *p‡2cg The Provok'd Wife.

Neale had tickets on this night for which it is customary to pay half price, the whole amount of his tickets in the House came to #22 7s. ($Powel=).  Receipts: #60 (Cross); #33 18s. 6d. (Powel).  +General Advertiser=, 23 June: Yesterday was married by the $Rev. Mr Franklin= at his Chapel +Russel St?=, +Bloomsbury=,--$David Garrick Esq.= to $Mlle Eva Maria Violette=.  Comments by John Powel in MS +Tit for Tat=: This was the last night of the season, having play'd 175 nights.  Rec'd by forfeits of the Band of Music #32 11d.  Rec'd ditto from actors #1 15s.  Rec'd of Mr Neale for half share of his tickets #11 3s. 6d.  So that they received as appears by their own books in the two seasons that Mr G k has been concern'd as manager, the sum of #40,906 2s. 7d. having play'd in the whole time 346 nights.  But as Mr Garrick's Benefit and $Mrs Cibber='s charges were included in the account as a blind to the Principle Treasurer, I must therefore, among some few other things, subtract them from the total amount, and then it will stand as follows: @The first season:@Cash return'd by licencer #2 2s.@G k's Benefit, whole amount of house #193 16s.@Mrs Cibber's charges at her Bt. #60@$Mr Berry= #1 10s.@$Mrs Pritchard= for a ticket as agreed #10 10s.@The last season G k receiv'd as author of +Lethe=, for 6th night #56 8s. 6d.@$Mr Warner= #5 14s.@G k's benefit as before #187@Mrs Cibber's charges #60@Mrs Pritchard's #10@Total #587 16s. 6d.@  The sum subtracted, it wil remain #40,318 6s. 1d., which is at the rate of #116 10s. 6d. for each night, one night with another, Benefit nights and all Disadvantages included.  As I have no given an exact account of the Receipts of Cash, I must also endeavor to give an account of the nightly charge, that the reader may be able to judge of the Profits.  But it must be first consider'd, that all nights will not amount to the same, as for example the play of +Macbeth= requires more incidents, than a common play, such as wine, fruit made use of in the Banqueting Scene, also spirits of wine for the Cauldron in the scene of the Witches, Rosin for lightening, &c.  Whereas in another play, such as the +Orphan= perhaps there are few or no incidents, and consequently the charges must be less, so that it is impossible to be quite exact without giving the particulars of each night's play throughout the two seasons which would not only tire the reader's patience, but swell this pamphlet to a greater bulk than the nature of the thing requires; besides as all the Account Books are in their own custody, there can be no such thing as making an abstract.  But as my own memorandums will let me into the most principle things, it is an easy matter to make an allowance for others of less consequence, which I shall take care as much as I can to do rather in their favor than against them.  In the first place I shall begin with their Rents and Taxes as they stood last season: @A Calculation of the Nightly Expence of Drury Lane Playhouse:@Renter's Shares in the House, being in number Thirty-Six at #23 6s. 8d. each share for the season amounts in all to #840, and supposing they play but 170 nights (tho' they play'd 175 last season which is allowing them as much advantage as I possibly can) then will it amount to per night #4 18s. 9d.@Land Tax for the year #88, which calculated at the rate of 170 nights as above, is per night 10s. 4d.@Ground Rent, and for the rent of a Wardrobe call'd the +Sparrow's Nest=, for the year #80, which is per night 9s. 4d.@Poor's rate for the year #33 6s. 8d., which is per night 3s. 11d.@Scavanger for the House, and another place call'd the +King's Passage=, for the year #7 9s. 4d., which is 10 1!2d.@Rent for a Place call'd the King's Passage for the year #31 10s., which is per night 3s. 8 1!4d.@Watch Rate for the Playhouse and a House in +Russel St=, call'd the King's Passage #7, which is per night 9 3!4d.@Window lights for the Playhouse and the King's Passage, #6 per year, which is per night 8 1!4d.@Water for the year, #2, which is per night 2 3!3d.@Rent of a room call'd the +Scene Room= for the year #60, which is per night 7s. 1!2d.@Fruit money to be divided among the renters, as by their Lease #40, which is per night 4s. 8 1!4d.@(N.B.: It has not been the custom for some years past to pay this money to the Renters, but as they are entitled to receive it, I think proper to make it one of the charges.)@A Perquisite payable out of the P t [Patent?] for the year #815, which is per night #1 1   7s. 1!2d.@The Total amount of their Rent and Taxes is per night #8 17s. 6d.@  Thus far I have given an account of their [rents] and Taxes and before I proceed any farther I believe it will be necessary to acquaint the reader, that the Renter's Lease will expire in the year 1753, and then the whole affair will come into the hands of Messrs G k and L y, for the term of near 21 years at an annual Rent of #210.  This is a purchase made not long ago, for which they gave #3000.  But the Annual rent of #210 commences before the Renters time is out, occasioned by an addition of several dwelling Houses in the Playhouse Passages which they had thrown into their agreement, and for some of which they now receive Rent.  The next principal charge is the Nightly Salaries of the people belonging to the House, such as actors, dancers, musicians, office keepers, doorkeepers, dressers, and sweepers.  The customary way of paying these people is once a week; on a Saturday Morning their names being all enter'd alphabetically upon a list (which is call'd the Pay List).  This List is always made out according to the number of nights that the House has played in the week, but I must set it down at 6 which is a full week's pay.  This is also a fluctuating affair, as well as the incidents, their generally being a necessity of either adding or striking off some names before the season is out, which consequently either makes an increase or decrease in the charges, but as I am oblig'd to be as particular as possible, and to bring it to a point, I will fix upon salaries of the latest date.  @Sat. Feb. 25, 1748-49.  The salaries amounted to per week #296 9s. 6d., and on Sat. 15 Apr. 1749, the salaries were per week #294 6d.  But as I chuse to make the thing rather more than less, I will enter it according to the former list, which is per night #49 8s. 8d.@N.B. $Mr Lacy= has #2 15s. 6d. per night upon this list for management, but I cannot comprehend that this is any part of the charge because he has a moity, or equal half-share of the Profits, as being a partner; and consequently ought not to be paid for inspecting into his own affairs.  I shall therefore subtract this from the Nightly expence at the end.@The next charge to be consider'd is that of the Tallow Chandler, which generally amounts to per week about #17, but this is not always certain, it varying sometimes either a trifle over or under.  This person makes an allowance of 8 per cent Discount upon account of his receiving ready money for his goods, which deducted from the #17 makes it per night #2 12s. 1d.@The Printer's Bill generally amounts to between #7 and #8 per week, but as I rather chuse to be over than under the mark, I will set it down at #8, which is per night #1 6s. 8d.@Advertisements in the +General Advertiser=, there has been nothing charg'd for these two years and upwards, which I believe is occasion'd by the Managers having a share in that paper, that perhaps may bring as much as their advertisements come to.@I shall find the greatest difficulty of any yet in making an Allowance for the nightly use of their cloaths, Scenes, &c, there being a vast number of rich cloaths bought into their wardrobe within these two years, and large sums paid to the Taylor, Mercer and other Tradesmen, on account of the same, but then the Stock remains, and will serve for a considerable time with some little addition, and it is well known the wardrobe was never so rich before, as at this juncture, a great many of the cloaths having been bought ready-made at dery great bargains, and when they are no longer fit to appear upon the stage, the Lace will burn to a considerable part of their money again; And as it is impossible to be quite exact, I must submit to the reader whether #3 3s. a Night only for the use of their cloaths, Scenes and other things that appertain to the dress, is not sufficient, for according to the calculation of playing 170 nights in the season it will amount to #535 10s., only for the use, which in my opinion is enough, and if they can contradict it let them make it appear #3 3s.@$Mr Fleetwood= (who was the late manager) when he made an assignment of the Playhouse to Mr Lacy in trust for the Bankers (Gr n, and Am r, late of the +Strand=) and himself to care to keep a Reserve of #500 a year during the Time then to come on the P t [patent?], a part of which has been paid annually to a Gentleman appointed to receive the same by Mr Fleetwood.  But when Mr G k came in as manager, it was agreed by the consent of that Gentleman, that it should be paid at the rate of #300 a year, and so to take a longer time for the payment of the whole.  This annuity had it stood at the rate of #500 a year as was first design'd would have expir'd with the P t, which is several months before the Renter's time is out, but this affair ought to be look'd upon rather as a Debt than part of the nightly charge of the Playhouse.  However, as it always stood in that Rank in their books, I shall make the same allowance here and leave the reader to judge of it as he thinks proper, which is per night according to the former calculation #1 15s. 3d.@The Lamp Lighter's bill for lighting the lamps will amount to about 7 shillings sixpence a night, but as there is an occasion sometimes for Tin Wares and reparations, I shall set it down at Per night 10s.@Coals made use of are generally about 40 Chaldrons for the season, which bought in the summer time, we must suppose not be to above 34s. a chaldron, amounting in the whole to #68, which is per night 8s.@Properties, or Incidents, are sometimes more, sometimes less, as I have before observed, and are according to the play.  They are under the Denomination of Fruit, Wines, Sweetmeats, Sticks, Stage Money, &c, but to take one night with another throughout the season they don't amount to quite 5s.@Bill Stickers are those men that stick the Large Bills about the Town, being Six in number, and have 18 pence per night each.  They are not enter'd on the pay List among other servants, on account of their sticking Bills sometimes when the House does not play, which makes a difference, and supposing them to be in full pay, which is not always the case, then it would amount to per night 9s.@Two men that deliver Handbills, at 1 shilling a night each per night 2s.@Four constant supernumerary scene-men to assist the scene-men belonging to the House, and a Candle-man that sees all tne candles put out after the play is over, at 1 shilling each, which is per night 5s.@There are sometimes extraordinary Supernumerary scene-men, made use of in plays, to help the traps, &c, such as +Richard III=, +Macbeth=, +The Tempest=, &c, which have a shilling each, but one night with another it will not amount to above 3s.@Kettle Drums and French Horns are not included among the Band of Music, and as there are but two French Horns, and one pair of Kettle Drums made use of, which are only in some particular things, at 5 shillings a night, I cannot think they will amount to throughout the season more than per night 7s. 6d.@Chorus singers, which are people that stand behind the scenes, whose additional voices are sometimes necessary in grand pieces of vocal music, and are made use of in the Tempest, +Comus=, Macbeth, &c., and seldom in number so many as 6, at 5 shillings each,--but if I make allowance for two each night throughout the season, I am very confident it is more than sufficient, which supposition is per night 10s.@The Prompter is allowed for Paper, Pens, Ink and Wafers per night 3d.@The Carpenters, being sometimes employed in doing work in the House, save 2s. 6d. a day each, and as this is also a fluctuating affair, I shall put them down throughout the season at per night 5s.@The Glover's bill amounts one night with another to about 6s.@The Stationer's Bill, perhaps about #15 in the season, every Boxkeeper, &c being oblig'd to find his own Paper, which is per night 1s. 9d.@The Feather-man, Shoe-maker, Sword-Cutler, Hatter, Taylor, Scene Painter, Lace-man, Mercer, &c, I have already made an allowance for,--the #3 3s. per night for the use of the Cloaths, Scenes, &c. ....@The Brick-layer and Iron-monger are casual tradesmen, and as accidents so frequently happen, I think it necessary to put them down at per night 7s. 6d.@The Turner's Bill perhaps may amount in the season to about #6 which is per night 8d.@The person that has the care of the Candles brings in a bill for small wax candles, &c, and one night with another about 1s. 6d.@The House-keeper sometimes brings in a bill for little things to the amount of about per night 1s.@The Prompter for writing parts, one night witn another 8d.@I have thus endeavored to give the most minute Part of the charges that belongs to the House, but as most of these affairs depends upon accident and for fear of any omission (At the beginning of the first season their salaries were a few weeks at #54 per night, but as this was but of a short duration it cannot make any great difference) and lest they say I fix them to certain sums which have alter'd to their disadvantage, I will as a guard against such a supposition allow them per night #3@#74 6s. 8d.@[Subtracting Mr Lacy's #2 15s. 6d.] then according to the nearest calculation I can make the whole nightly charge is #71 11s. 2d.@  The next thing to be consider'd (supposing this charge to be right) is their Profits, which will appear by multiplying the sum of #71 11s. 2d. by 346 (the number of nights they play'd in the two seasons) and the total sum will be #24,759 10s. 10d., which subtracted from #40,318 6s. 1d., the remainder will be #15,558 15s. 2d., the profits, according to the best calculations I can make arising from the two last seasons.  But I think it incumbent on me to inform the reader that this money was not all at the Managers' disposal, because there was a mortgage upon the Playhouse, &c to one $Mr Clutterbuck?=, a tradesman in the Strand, who was Mortgagee in trust for Mr G k himself and others, and the Mortgagee was entitled to take up #1000 a year and interest at 5 per cent.  This security was made at Mr G k's first commencing manager in order to purchase the Bankers' two shares in the old P t, &c. which was sold for #3,500, also to discharge an old mortgage made by Mr Fleetwood, and other debts due from the playhouse.  Thus have I made appear to the Town the receipts and charges as near as possibly can, and hope not to the disadvantage of the Managers.  But perhaps they will say that they have expended more money than I have already given an account of, which I must readily submit to, but then it has been upon different affairs than the nightly charge of the House; as for example the first season they, as will appear by their own Books, #15,179 12s. 3d.; the second season #13,663 3s. 3d., so at this rate the profits do not amount to above #10,475 10s. 8d., which is noways right, for as I have already observed, they bought large quantities of ready-made rich cloaths, merely because they were great bargains.  These cloaths they now have by them, and doubtless are as good as money, and which I make an allowance for at #3 3s. a night.  They also made alterations in the House, by enlarging the first Gallery, and adding more seats, which are placed so neighborly together, that they keep people pure warm in a cole [sic] winter's night, especially at the upper end.  The transformation of that Part adjoining to the Box-Lobby into a standing place for the Quality, that they may pay before they go in, is another charming contrivance, and many other alterations much to advantage, but these conveniences being once finish't become Perpetual, and are no longer chargeable.  Besides they lent out of the said sums money to several actors for some of which they have bonds that bear 5 per cent interest, and these are the things that were the occasion of the Extraordinary Advancement, which perhaps they under a pretence may call part of the Nightly charges, but as I have made the thing as clear as well can be, I shall submit to the reader's judgment.  I thought it necessary to set down each night's farce with the play as near as I could throughout the two seasons, and I believe upon strict examination the reader will find that the whole number consists of about 25 good old Stagers, one of them having mounted upwards of that times.  But however dis[agreea]ble these antient attendants may prove to an Audience, yet they are absolutely necessary on account of keeping up the [star%f--l P[rice]s, which could not decently be done without them as $Mr Rich= has Pantomime entertainments.  [star%Whilst their rent, Taxes, &c are so very high, it is my firm opinion, they cannot afford to take under full prices, and therefore I would not have any one imagine to the Contrary.  And the reason of publishing this account is no more than to do my self common justice and to shew how well they could afford to make me amends for my past Labours.  Tho in my opinion Mr G-k is such a rarity, that he needs no embellishment, and I hope I shan't be thought too lavish in his Praise when I say that his great condesention in playing oftener since he has been a manager (almost in spite of his sickness) than he did when he was under management, is such an obligation conferr'd on the town, that it is questionable whether the salary he now receives as an Actor is equivalent.  But lest it should not be generally known what it is (as such things do sometimes slip the ears of the People) I think it proper to inform the Reader, and having first ask'd Mr Garrick the manager's pardon, I shall begin with Mr Garrick the Actor, whose salary for the season is #525 certain, and as most players have a benefit once a year, so has he, but only this difference, that they pay for theirs (Mrs Cibber excepted) and he does not.  Nor need he give himself any trouble to make an interest at the time; for it is only playing +Richard=r, or +Lear=r, and the job is done without putting his name up in large characters at the top of the Playbill, for every inquisitive person to gape at.  What these Benefits have brought him in is easily seen by looking backwards.  This added to the salary makes upwards of #700 a year, and so much for Mr G-k the actor.  As to Mr Garrick the Manager, he only takes up #500 a year out of the profits under the denomination of Management, which does but just put him upon a footing with his brother manager, who takes up the same, and if I may presume to put the Manager and Actor together, it will appear that Mr Garrick's income from the Playhouse is upwards of #1200 a year exclusive of a Mortgage of #4000 upon the Playhouse, Patent, Cloaths, Scenes, &c., which brings him in #200 per year, at the rate of 5 per cent interest.  These things put together and added to his half share of Profits, makes it a comfortable living enough, and I heartily wish every brave fellow that ventured his life and limbs for his Country's service could meet with the same success.  I make no doubt but it will create some wonder that I have laid these things before the Town, without saying for why.  But I must assure the reader that after weighing every circumstance well within my own breast, I think I have sufficient reason, and would relate each particular reason, but that I have given to understand Facts may be Libels--that all advantages will be taken--that I must have a care what I do, and that Power may get the better of Truth.  I must confess I think it very hard that if a man is hurt he must not only suffer the injury, but be also hindered from telling his grievance.  However, as I have often groan'd in private, I will run the risk of venturing one groan in public, but will be as concise as possible, for fear my antagonists may be too impatient to stay till my tale is told.  Let it suffice them that I was Deputy Treasurer of D-y L-ne Playhouse upwards of four years, and resigened my office the beginning of this season.  Several messages were sent to me to return again, and I had my place kept for me several weeks, which plainly shows I have been guilty of no misdemeanor, but have been rather look'd upon as a valuable sl-ve than other ways, and could I have been content with much more labor and little pay I don't doubt but I might have been suffer'd to trudge on and carry my Burthen to the end of my days.  But having forgot my station, and that I had no right to make terms for myself, was so impudent as to imagine I had some Gratitude due me for past services, and that as I had weather'd a most terrible Storm, I had some right to share in the calm, but alas!  I was mistaken.  Property was not intended for me, I was only design'd to share in Adversity and help others to cut their passage to happiness.  I believe it is pretty well known that near two years before Mr G-k came in as manager, the Playhouse was involved [in] many difficulties, much money being due to tradesmen, Actors, &c occasioned by his not playing there, which [would] not have been the case had Mr Lacy, who was then manager in trust for the Bankers and himself, agreed with him, and given what he demanded as an actor, which was as Mr Lacy order'd him #500 for the season, and as Mr G-k did not chuse to be under him he went to +Ireland= where he remain'd during the season.  The Bankers who advanc'd #6,800 to purchase the Playhouse, the Renters, and Mr Lacy begun to see their folly, and were so unfortunate as to become Bankers' prey afterwards, though one of them ($Mr Amber=) has had the grant to be made a Pit office-keeper in the Playhouse, where he now remains at a salary of about #29 a year.  I shall return to the difficulties.  The People that had the demands to them (being upwards of #140) began to be very uneasy, and they very clamorous, that we perceiv'd what we were to depend upon.  Distruction, seemingly as it was a dark cloud over our heads, we expected daily to burst upon us; and tho' Mr Lacy had given as many fair promises as a man could do, yet it availed nothing, for every word they spoke had something of danger in it (which oblig'd him to keep pretty much within doors).  Here I interposed, and stood between him and his creditors, for upwards of a year and a half, ever breaking my rest to preserve his, and was continually forming excuses and pledging my word, to divert them from their design, and as it was unsafe for him to come to the playhouse for a long time together, for fear of arrests, I was oblig'd to undertake the management there (which they now take up #500 a year for) and go through a very hard Task to an account of the people's not having their pay.  Added to this I had the Accounts of the Treasurer's Office to keep and as we were in debt every particular person's belonging to the playhouse, beside.  I also took upon myself the Inspection of the Wardrobe and kept an account of that (which was almost one man's business alone to do).  I drew all the articles between the manager and actor, and at other times were [sic] continually either writing, walking, though lame, or contriving for Mr Lacy's welfare.  In the day I had no rest, in the night very little sleep, and my whole study was to extricate him from his troubles.  I was bail for him to the Sheriff in two actions for #200, and brought at the suit of Mr Fl-dyer in +Bazinghall St=, and Mr Ho-se, Tinman in +High Holborn=, and had a great deal of trouble in getting one of these actions defended in order to gain time.  I was arrested twice myself for him: one of these times dragg'd out of my lodgings at twelve o'clock at night.  In short I went through every trouble that a sincere friend could do, while he was endeavouring to get the new Patent, which he and Mr Garrick now enjoy, and did imagine if ever those difficulties were got over (which I then very much question'd) that I should have met with some gratification, but instead of that as soon as Mr G-k came to be concern'd as a partner (who knew very well that I had gone through for the service of the Playhouse) I found another Person was to be put in Principal Treasurer over my head, with this Reason: "That it was their interest it should be so, because his Wife, Mrs Pr-h-d was to play for them."  Not that I envy the gentleman that has it, for I think him worthy of much more, and hope my being under a necessity of mentioning it will be a sufficient plea for my excuse.  This I very easily look'd over, and had not the least doubt but they would make me some amends another way, but adding something to my salary, which was at the rate of #44 a year, and this I was entitled to for doing the business of Deputy treasurer in the Office which was nothing in competition with the other affairs I had gone through.  But I found I was mistaken here too for I had no addition, and discover'd when too late that I should have made use of the opportunity when I had it in my power,--but though I knew the time when everything must have been granted that I ask'd, yet I did not take the advantage, nor would by compulsion force the thing that I knew was due from the strongest ties of Friendship.  How wretched must such a disappointment make me!  What must that man deserve that can betray such confidence, and without blushing deny the breach he had made in Honour.  If after this I can point out a way to do myself justice, have I not Right to make use of it?  Must I lose my health, Time, Labor, for other's happiness, and not consider my miseries?  It is against Nature and I hope the Reader will make my Case his own, and then judge accordingly.  In my next I shall give the full history of the Stage ever since Mr Fl-w-d was manager, down to the end of the last season, wherein will be the Bankers' affair set forth at large.  The manner of obtaining the new P-t, and Gratitude displayed in a particular manner.  The intended partnership between Mr Rich and Mr Lacy, how Mr Garrick came to be admitted.  His compact with Mrs Pritchard, and some other affairs necessary to be known both to the Public and the Theatres.  @Then let the stricken deer go weep@The hart ungall'd go play...&c. &c.@Finis.@  [Powel's second pamphlet seems not to have been written, as this one seems never to have been printed.  His total income for the two seasons #40,906 2s. 7d. corresponds favorably with Cross's total estimates for the same period of #40,995.  His analysis of the cost of many items in his attempt to arrive at a reasonable statement of nightly charges is most valuable.  If his figure of #71 11s. 2d. is correct, then the managers lost from #8 to #11 on each benefit night, which hardly seems probable.]  *p‡“hay The Knights.

I am convinced we have an artist at present among us, as excellent in his way as ever was seen in +Britain=.

Sir: Having read an advertisement of a performance call'd +Concerto Spirituale=, for the Benefit of $Mr Geminiani=, on Friday 6 April next, I could not avoid making a few remarks to the public on the occasion, which, if you will favour with a place in your Paper it may perhaps be of service to his undertaking, and will greatly oblige, Sir your humble Serv't, $J. B.=  When Mr Geminiani came first over here, the great excellence of the Violin was unknown in this kingdom, and the great improvement our countrymen have made on that instrument is entirely owing to him.  The valuable works he has produc'd in the instrumental way, are greater indications of his merit, as an author, than any I can offer in his behalf; this is the only Benefit he ever made, therefore I persuade myself that the Public (who are justly famous for their Generosity on such laudable occasions) will give him the encouragement his Merit deserves.  *pˆĞcg Theodora.

To the Publick: Walking in +St James's Park= the other day, I followed two young Gentlemen along the Mall, and overheard one of them say to the other, "shall we go and offer sacrifice to the Manes of $Milton=?"  To which the other reply'd "with all my heart."  I must own I had some curiosity to know in what this ceremony would consist, and determined to observe them.  I accordingly followed them at some distance, into $Dodsley= the Bookseler's in +Pall Mall=; where to my great satisfaction I found that this most acceptable sacrifice was only an offering of Charity to the Granddaughter of Milton; who on account of her age, her poverty, and her relation to that great Man, is to have a Benefit at +Drury Lane Theatre= on Wednesday next.  I willingly joined in their devotions, and rejoice with the Publick on their having an opportunity of shewing their gratitude and Veneration to a man whose Genius reflects a lustre on the +British Literature=, and whose sentiments have added strength to the +British liberties=; to an author whose works have been the delight of our Fathers, and will be the Admiration of our sons: latest posterity; to an Englishman who is not only the Glory of our Country, but the Honour to Human Nature.  This fair Opportunity of paying a respect to his Memory (the last of the kind that can be offered to us, as $Mrs Foster= is the only surviving branch of his family) must certainly be embraced with Eagerness and pleasure; all who have any pretence to an Elegant Taste, all lovers of Liberty, and every friend of the Muses, will surely crowd to the house on this distinguish'd night, and give at once an instance of the politeness of their manners, and the goodness of their hearts, I am, &c.

The next thing to be consider'd is disapprobation, which I think may be sufficiently shewn, by an attention to something else, by loud discourse, profuse laughter, and the like.  I cannot help thinking it a little out of character, for a polite audience to distort their features by a hiss: however for the sake of some ambitious youths, who thus love to signalize themselves, I shall leave a new play to their mercy.  They then are at liberty to exercise their several talents whether they hiss or groan most successfully, or have a greater genius for the cat-call.  If you desire to know when you are to shew your dislike, my answer is, when anything displeases you, or in fine when you will provided you have a strong party to second you; for the best hiss or groan in the universe may be drown'd in a general applause.  [Never laugh at what passes on stage save it be an error, blunder, or accident.  In tragic scenes avoid being visibly moved by humming a tune, regarding the audience, engaging in conservation, or turning your back to the stage.  When a female social rival calls attention to herself and away from the stage, let fall your handkerchief into the pit, or call out to an acquaintance in the opposite box, or burst into loud and unexpected laughter.  You'll know when to applaud, for the actors will tell you.]  On these occasions +Cato=r looks more than unusually big, +Hamlet=r stares with great emphasis, +Othello=r has a most languishing aspect, +Monimia=r is all sighs and softness, +Beatrice=r will bridle, and pretty +Peggy Wildair=r leers you into a clap.

There is not one elegant expression or moral sentiment in the dialogue; nor indeed one character in the drama, from which either could be expected.  It is however, to be wished that the Town, which opposed this play with so much zeal, would exclude from the theatre every other in which there is not more merit; for partiality and prejudice will be suspected in the treatment of new plays, while such pieces as the +London Cuckolds=, and the +City Wives Confederacy=, are suffered to waste time and debauch the morals of society....Upon the whole the Author appears to have intended rather entertainment than instruction, and to have disgusted the Pit by adapting his comedy to the taste of the Galleries....Perhaps the ill success of this comedy is chiefly the effect of the author's having so widely mistaken the character of +Gil Blas= whom he has degraded from a man of sense, discernment, true humor, and great knowledge of mankind...to an impertinent silly, conceited coxcomb, a mere +Lying Valet=, with all the affectation of a Fop, and all the insolence of a coward.

This continued till about December the 16th, when all my friends thought me near expiring, and the more because I was then in the 80th year of my age.  At this time my relations gave me a dose of +Dr James's Fever Powder= in some Tamarinds, unknown to me, which, as it had no taste, I did not discover.  This gave me one stool, and the next morning I was much better.  From that Time my Relations gave me the same medicine, without my knowledge, in small beer, Tea, and every thing I took.  This was attended with so good an Effect, that in three days the Fever, with all its symptoms, entirely left me, insomuch that I am now perfectly recover'd.

The tragedy of +Othello=, we are told is the play the Gentlemen have pitched on.  The theatre being engaged to some Gentlemen and ladies for a private play tomorrow, the +Masque of Alfred= is oblig'd to be deferr'd till Saturday next.

Surely a pension would not be ill employed on some men of wit, learning and virtue, who might have power to strike out every offensive and unbecoming passage from plays already written, as well as those that may be offered to the stage for the future, by which, and other wise regulations, the theatre might become a very innocent and useful diversion instead of being a scandal and reproach to our religion and country."]  Receipts: #120 ($Cross=).  *p‹>cg The Beggar's Opera.

See the +Gentleman's Magazine=, 1752, p. 43; and $Horace Walpole='s letter to $Montagu= 12 May 1752, as follows:  It appeared the lowest buffoonery in the world, even to me who am used to my uncle Horace.  There is a bad oration to ridicule, what is too like, Orator Henley; all the rest is perverted music.  There is a man who plays so nimbly on the kettle drums, that he has reduced that noisy instrument to be an object of sight; for if you don't see the tricks with his hands, it is no better than ordinary.  Another play  on a violin and trumpet together; another mimics a bagpipe with a +German flute=, and makes it full if disagreeable.  There is an admired dulcimer, a favourite saltbox and a really curious Jew's Harp.  Two or three men intend to persuade you that they play on a broomstick, which is drolly brought in, carefully shrouded in a case, so as to be mistaken for a bassoon or bass viol, but they succeed in nothing but the action.  The last fellow imitates farting and curtseying to a +French horn=.  There are twenty medley overtures, and a man who speaks a prologue and epilogue, in which he counterfeits all the actors and singers upon earth' (+The Yale Edition of Horace Walpole's Correspondence=, IX, p. 131).

Upon this the Justice despatched $Mr. Welch= in the Evening with a Party of Soldiers to apprehend the Persons concerned in the Representation of the Play, which was the Tragedy of +Venice Preserved=.  +Jaffier=r, +Pierre=r, +Belvidera=r, and most of the principal Characters, were taken, and some of them, particularly Belvidera, were brought in their Theatrical attire before the Justice.  The Men all appeared to be young Apprentices and the Woman a young Milliner; wherefore the Justice was unwilling to proceed against them as Rogues and Vagabonds, as they are made by the last Vagrant Act; in which case they must have been committed to +Bridewell=, which might have proved their Ruin; He treated them therefor as guilty of an unlawful assembly, and a common Nuisance; for which they were either bound for their good Behavior, or committed for want of Sureties, and soon after discharged.  It was sworn before the Justice that Sunday had been the usual Day of rehearsing their Parts (+General Advertiser=, 17 Aug.).  *p
