For singers and dancers see following letter.]  Sir: I am one of those to whom an Oratorio or an Opera (whether Italian or English) gives exquisite delight; and am therefore glad that, as the town is now full, those entertainments will, very probably, be crowded; and thus amply repay the several managers, for the great risk they run, as to their property, as well as for the vast pains they take to amuse us; for the labour employed, on those occasions, is infinitely greater than is usually imagined.  The Italian opera has suffered considerably, this season, by the inability of $Sga Spagnoli= to exert her musical talents, owing to a most severe cold; but as she has now recovered her voice, 'tis presumed that she will be a source of as great pleasure, among us, to persons of a musical ear, and who have a true taste for that species of dramas, as she was in her native country, where she was always heard with great applause.  I myself find great charms in the entertainments, as now exhibiting at the +King's Theatre=: for, besides Sga Spagnoli's taste I do not perceive the least diminution in $Sg Elisi='s voice or action, both of which pleased us so much two or three years ago.  $Ciprandi= appears to me a fine player as well as singer; and with regard to $Sg Savoi=, he is generally thought to have a pleasing voice.

[The writer wishes not to cry down every entertainment he cannot relish himself and adds], "I have long endeavoured to find out the reason why plays should not be performed on Wednesdays and Fridays in Lent as well as on those days all through the rest of the season.  I have never yet been able to find out that Lent makes the least difference in people's way of living."  [He wonders, however, why the non-sacred oratorios such as +Acis and Galatea= and +Alexander's Feast= have been allowed performance.  He then registers a mild complaint about the management of the Oratorios because they do not include sufficient solo instrumental entertainment between the parts.] "This custom was wholly dropped last year, and I complained greatly of it in a letter which you did me the favour to insert.  I was greatly surprised to find $Mr Pinto=, who then led the band, was either not permitted or not paid to play a solo, as well as $Mr Hay=, who played one every night the preceding season.  $Mr Stanley='s illness not permitting him then to play, that omission was overlooked, though it might have been supplied by a performer on some other instrument.  This season the managers have thought proper to treat their audience with one solo or concerto every night, but why not have two?"  [He liked $Barthelemon='s solos, but lamented that Stanley sat idle, and he offered final advice that the managers should alternate the solo instruments for "pleasing variety."

A few evenings ago I was at the New Comedy of the +Clandestine Marriage=, where, I assure you I was greatly entertained; but at the conclusion of the last act, must own was not a little surprised to find +Miss Sterling=r so much neglected, as I was at that instant wondering what kind of Apology +Sir John=r would make her, when behold he stands close by her without saying a word; which in my opinion concludes the play too abruptly.  The author indeed has not placed her in the most excellent light; yet as a Lady, and of Character, shall I say of Fortune too, some Apology on the Gentleman's side seems naturally to arise from the incidents of the piece.  But perhaps I am mistaken, which I am the more willing to imagine from the known abilities of the ingenious authors.  If any of your critical correspondents should think it worth their while to set me right in that Particular, it will be esteemed a favour." ($Frances Street=, March 5.)  *p Ècg Love Makes a Man.

I remember to have seen a darkish way down a flight of steps to a dismal winding staircase, which I was told led to the footman's gallery, and, supposing that the road I was to take on this occasion, was very agreeably undeceived by being shewn up about halfway to the five shilling gallery, and by a turn through an arch introduced to a new and convenient staircase leading to this region of the gods, where I was surprised to find myself arrived before I thought I was half-way up.  The managers have indeed made this place very neat and commodious, by rendering the descent much less steep, lowering and matting the benches, painting and lighting the whole place; so that I found myself as much at my ease there, as in any other part of the house, and much better situated than I had expected; likewise, by their following $Mr Garrick='s example, in removing the pendant lustres, and lighting after the foreign manner, you have a full view of the whole stage; by which the magnificance appears greatly increased.  The performance was beyond my expectations, as I think the performers excel any in their way which have appeared in this country; but I need not expatiates upon a subject the town in general have been, or I dare say will be, as good judges of as yours, &c.  *p¡¿dl The Alchemist.

Printed for $G. Kearsly=   N.B. This Pamphlet is entered at +Stationers Hall=, whoever pyrates any part of it will be prosecuted.  [This pamphlet of 50 pages is given a four-column review in the +Gentleman's Magazine= for March (p. 124).  The controversy was over a play which $Shebbeare= submitted to $Beard= and which the latter finally rejected after holding it two seasons.  Beard's letters are quoted.  The reviewer is severe upon Shebbeare:  Upon the whole for anything that has hitherto appeared, the managers of both theatre have rather been to blame for receiving some pieces that they should have rejected, than for rejecting any they should have received.  No piece has yet been printed, by the rejection of which the managers have betrayed their trust, or neglected their duty to the public.  There may be such pieces in manuscript, but, if there are, the most effective way of avenging the author on the manager is to print them, for the voice of the public would instantly and effecturally do justice to the writter...by compelling the representation.'

Put on my old clothes and at 5 went to +Drury Lane=, found the Pit and 2s. gallery quite full, at last had myself squeezed into the Pit, where I was most woefully pressed, but saw very well and got a seat ere the farce began.  The play was +Cymbeline=, with +The Deuce is in Him=.  This play pleases me.  The dresses were tolerably proper, ye scenes (particularly that of +Imogen=r's chamber and the Cave) pretty and ye performance of ye principal characters good, but having never read the play, lost a great deal of the effect.

The gods called for it on Monday last, but desisted on the above excuse being made.  Almost eleven ere all was over.

Some Masters and leading Journeymen are taken off.  [Cast listed.]  +The Citizen= was vilely performed, except  +Old Philpot=r by $Weston=.  $Palmer= is not equal to ye young one.  They went off without concluding it.  We had ye +Builders Prologue= before ye farce, by ye same means we had it last night.

I often go to both theatres, have seen $Garrick= and $Mrs Yates=, who are the first in this theatrical sphere.  The former has hitherto [i.e., this season] appeared only in comedy, --his manner, his humour, and his judgment are not to be equall'd.  The adoration he meets with from $the English= is equal to his merit.  His every motion they attend to, and every turn of his eye seems to transport them.  $Mrs Yates= [at +Covent Garden=] has much tragic merit.  Her low voice is very tuneful, her feeling great, her action peculiarly graceful and her figure uncommonly fine.  She has more power than $Mrs Dancer= (at +Drury Lane=] and more variety than $Mrs Fitz-Henry=, tho' less strength and compass.

Woodward was allowed to speak the prologue, but as soon as the curtain drew up catcalls began.  When the performers retired, Powell spoke several times, but was not heard.  I was told that the author ($Mr Colman=) desires to know whom he has offended.  The Pros were a very great majority, and at last after a contest of better than 1!2 an hour, the victory was over and the piece was performed.  I think it contains many good sentiments, and excellent instruction to young men and is not unworthy of Mr Colman.  If vice must not be exposed to hatred and contempt, the usefulness of our theatres is at an end.  Only I think the Covent Garden pleasures are represented in too favourable a light.

Mrs Dancer's answer was: Their compliments to the Managers, that it was now too late, & that Mr Barry has wrote word they should not go to Ireland as the Managers seem'd against it & that Mr Barry & She was ready to do anything the Managers desir'd, as long as the House was open.  I ask'd, if they stay'd, if she thought Mr Barry would be able to play in Zenobia the Thursday following, & if it would be agreeable to her do play +Mrs Sullen= [+Stratagem=] the next week.  Her answer was she would play that or anything else the Managers pleas'd & that she was going to Mr Barry the next morning & that she would send word if he thought he should be able to play in Zenobia on Thursday next.

After one unsuccessful attempt got into the Pit with the greatest difficulty after the third act.  Garrick is inimitably great in Richard & very different from the other Richards I have seen; his expression of the dying agony of that wretch is beyond description.  Some actors speak with as strong & loud voice in that scene as if they had received no wound & were not dying.  One $Lloyd=, who waits on Garrick sometimes, observed that he himself says he never acted better in his life, modestly observing that something must be allowed to the improvement of his judgment.

"His real name was $Rottan=, but altered euphonia gratia.  He was designed for a surgeon and served his apprenticeship at +Bath=.  The following playbills show that he met with approbation on the stage.  He remained with +Covent Garden= from this time till the end of the season 1785-86.  He then played in +Ireland= one Winter, and was engag'd at +Drury Lane Theatre= in the beginning of the season 1787-88.  This was the occasion of Mr Wroughton's leaving Covent Garden, I mean it was thus conjectured.  $Mr Lewis= had been appointed manager of that theatre for $Mr Harris=.  Mr Lewis and Mr Wroughton lived next door neighbors in +Broad Court= at the top of +Bow Street=, and were sworn friends:--they laughed together, lived together--In the season 1784-85 two new performers $Mr Holman= and $Mr Pope=, appeared on the +Covent Garden Stage=--these young men were great favorites with Mr Harris; Mr Holman, attracting at this time very crowded audiences, stood so particularly high in his regard, that his partiality made him guilty of some injustice to older and abler actors in the theatre.  $Mr Henderson= had really cause to complain of neglect; and Mr Wroughton thought himself equally oppressed.  At this time we had a Club and met every Wednesday fortnight during +Lent= at the +Long Room= in +Hamstead= at dinner.  Our Club consisted of a certain number of us belonging indifferently to either theatre, and two or three other gentlemen who were not actors.  $Mr King=, $Mr Quick=, $Mr Farren=, $Mr Mattocks=, myself, etc., etc.  When the bottle had a little warmed Mr Wroughton he threw out some sarcasms on his Friend Mr Lewis's management; Mr Lewis retorted; Their tempers grew hot, their words grew aggravating; Mr Wroughton struck Mr Lewis; Mr Lewis returned the blow.  They were parted; all the pleasures of the day were over, and the Club broke up in confusion.  I was not present this day, but have related what $Mr Siddons= told me of this Quarrel, and I imagine that Mr Wroughton's attack on Mr Lewis sprang from a suspicion that he was too willing to execute Mr Harris's designs in favour of Mr Holman.

[A letter from $Timotheus= in the +Public Advertiser=: "I repeatedly see in your paper an advertisement from the managers of the opera to solicit subscriptions from the Nobility and Gentry to enable them to carry it on.  Surely, from the specimin they have already given us of their performance in the serious way, never had managers less claim to the countenance and favour of the public.  In the whole company but one voice, and that just tolerable and no more; compared indeed to the rest a nightengale.  Then, Sir, for their dancers, they seem so perfectly so well suited to the singers, that 't is difficult to pronounce to which of them the palm should be allotted.  For the Figurers, one only excepted, they seem in that article to have paid a due attention to their want of every Talent requisite, by reducing them to so small a number that they look like so many mice scudding about an empty barn.  In short, Singers, Dancers, Figurers, Cloaths, Decorations, etc., etc., are all so much of a piece, that if the directors either can't or won't engage better performers, the sooner an end is put to the exhibition of Operas the better it will be."

Such experiments have not proved fruitless.  The most brilliant and interesting of which was the young lady's appearance on +Covent Garden Theatre= last night, in the character of Juliet.  So great was her terror, on presenting herself for the first time before a crowded audience, that, deprived of all her powers, she fell down on the stage in a swoon. The first act in consequence, was all terror on her side, all compassion and anxiety on that of the audience.  But having had time between the first and second Acts to recover from her panic, she shone forth in the Balcony Scene the most pleasing promise of a young tragic actress that has been seen for half a century past, and continued so throughout.  Her person is genteel, her tone of voice insinuating, variable, and melodious; her recitation is just and sensible; very affecting in the pathetic parts; condescending, free, and polite are the familiar speeches with the +Nurse=.  She is happily devoid of all stage whine, and tragedy Cant.  The manner she has been rudimented in does great honour to her instructors, who have so judiciously prevented the so excellent actor of this verily a $Shakespeare='s Juliet, from being sophisticated by the studied tricks, and false ornamenting of mistaken modern and degenerate art.  *p¤Úking's Il Viaggiatori Tornati.  *p¤Üdl The Hypocrite.

Her face is oval with an aqualine nose and though from the timidity of a first appearance the rest of her features lost that necessary animation, yet there were periods when she could disposses herself of her confusion, that prognosticated great expression of countenance.  Her voice was clear, commanding, and melodious, and her ear and manner both excellent.  She is that kind of singer that one can be pleased from looking at as well as from hearing, --an excellence few vocal performers possess.  Her acting abstracted from her voice would have done credit to a first appearance, as it was very pleasing and properly accompanied....What the managers could mean in casting +Lucy= for $Miss Pope= is extraordinary, as she sung, or indeed rather squalled every song so much out of tune that it was impossible for the music to accompany her; we do not however mean by this to cast the least reflection on so excellent an actress, as her spirited and judicious manner of playing it almost atoned for that of singing it.  *p¦ˆcg Hamlet.

A Citizen whose circumstances will not allow him often to attend Theatrical amusements, and who wishes to be entertained for his money, desires a nuisance may be removed which has totally deprived him of all satisfaction the few nights that he has been in the first gallery of your house.  Of a cool evening the company within generally draw up the wooden shutters of the openings improperly called windows.  An when the gentry without, who are admitted at half-price, find them shut, they begin a violent noise with their sticks, while those within as obstinately insist, that being in a violent heat, they will not let them down to the endangering their healths, by sudden letting in the cold air.  Thus a riot is commenced, which frequently stops the play.  It was the case in the Best Scene in the +Orphan=, the first night the +Court of Alexander= was performed.  N.B. The orange girls shamefully encourage it.  But the covetousness of the managers is the origin of the evil, by suffering intruders at half-price, after the inside of the gallery is completely filled.  If this remonstrance fails, you may expect worse effects, from the injured parties.
