Upon this he was desired with one general acclamation to proceed in the play.  The disturbers of the public were ordered to be silent or to be turned out of the house; and this great actor proved, by the improvement he has made in this character, that excellent as he is, he is still capable of reaching new strokes of perfection; and in the conclusion of the play the applause he met with was the tribute of hearts gratefully agitated through the whole performance with a variety of passions thrown into a ferment by powers most wonderfully suited to tenderness and compassion (+London Chronicle=, 3-6 Dec.).  *p”fdl The Fatal Marriage.

On 16 March the following letter appeared in the +Public Advertiser=: "Upon reading Ryan's advertisement of a New Dramatic Satire, I was extremely pleas'd with a Description of the motive that occasioned it.  He being last week at dinner with a set of particular friends, they inquired what Play and Farce he had chose this year for his Benefit.  He inform'd them the +Siege of Damascus= and Lethe.  Lethe, replied a Gentleman is very pleasing, but your friends have seen it, and you must fall into the fashion of having a new additional Scene; for a little bit of novelty may give assistance to its merit, and prove to your advantage.  Why, then, said a facetious Gentleman, who sat very near him, Pray sir, do you write him one; 'twill cost you little trouble, and, you know, you are very capable.  No more capable than yourself, Good Sir, answered the other; but to show I am full as willing, if you'll attempt to please his friends with one, upon my word I'll use my best endeavor to do the same, in writing of another.  We need not fear Severity, for none will blame a friendly inclination to serve a man, who, I believe everyone wishes well.  "Twas agreed, but $Ryan= judiciously observed, 'twould be a shame that two Gentlemen, each capable of writing to give an audience satisfaction, should condescend to make mere Lacqueys of their pens, and send them forth to hold the tail of +Lethe=; therefore if they should once begin, let them each write only one Hour longer, and they might raise a Structure of their own.

The two first acts of this play, as it is performed at the above theatre, were written by $Shakespear=; the three last for the most part by $Mr. Thomson=.  But how a man of $Mr Sheridan='s knowledge (who first introduc'd it there about four years ago) could think of pounding into one substance two things so heterogeneous in their natures as the productions of those authors, is to me amazing.  $Mr Smith= enters in the first act, after having (as we are to suppose) just overcome the +Volsci=r, to the tune of violins and hautboys; but I am a little afraid the grandeur of his triumph is a little misapplied, considering the early times in which $Coriolanus= lived, before the +Roman empire= had arrived to any degree of splendor and magnificence, and was great in virtue only.  However it makes a fine show; and Mr Smith, who has an excellent person, by the help of a little burnt cork and a real coat of mail cuts a very martial appearance.  I think it was one of $the Gracchi=, who, when he was speaking to the people, always had a servant behind him in the Rostrum with a pitch-pipe which he touched whenever he found his master's voice rising beyond a certain height; such an instrument as this would, in my opinion, be of service to Mr Smith, for his fault seems to be that of keeping too much at the top of his vioce.  $Mrs Hamilton= in the part of +Veturai=r, especially in the last act, excells herself; and in particular, she repeats that line: "He never can be lost who saves his country," with the genuine spirit of a free-born +Englishman=.  By the unnatural conjunction which is attempted to be made in this tragedy, most of the other characters are robbed of their significance.  Those two excellent actors, therefore, $Ryan= and $Sparks=, only give us just cause to regret that the parts of +Tullus=r and +Volscius=r are not longer....After the play was presented a Ballad Opera called +The Contrivances=; in which some good comedians are oblig'd to submit to the drudgery of supporting as contemptible a trifle as ever was acted on the stage.  *p•Ädl Tamerlane.

This monstruous production of nonsense and obscenity, is the spawn of one $Ravenscroft=, a writer whose wit was as contemptible as his morals were vitious.  He does not seem to have had one sentiment either of a man of Genious of a gentleman, at least if we may judge by the characters he has daubed, which are a pack of reprobates of the lowest kind.  Nor are the things which look like incidents in this play the produce of his own invention, but the squeezings from an extravagant novel of $Scarron=, and two or three ill-chosen fables of $LaFontaine=; of which ingredients he has contrived to mix up a sort of hog-wash, sweetened with a few luscious expressions and a large portion of the grossest lewdness, to the palates of swine, or what is the same thing, men like them; but which must be odious to, and nauseated by all people of delicate taste, or common modesty.  The three gallants in this comedy, +Townly=r, +Ramble=r and +Loveit=r, never make their appearance upon the stage but to talk bawdy, and that in terms very little different from the most vagabond inhabitants of +Covent Garden=, nor do they make their exit but with a professed intention to commit adultery with one woman or another, who walks off with him very contentedly for that purpose.  I must here observe that adultery is committed no less than seven times during the five acts.  [The play an insult to the +London= aldermen and their wives.]  There were several men of distinction in the boxes at this play, and I think about eight ladies.  What their inward feelings might be I know not; but if one might judge of their thoughts by the gravity of their looks, they were rather mortified than diverted.  But of the women of the town, who as we suppose were unwilling to let slip so fair an opportunity of getting a supper and a bed-fellow, there were crowds both in the pit and green boxes....  *p•Êdl The Wonder.

To begin exactly at Seven.  *p˜‹hay Comment.  *c˜‹hay $MMr Hartry= is oblig'd to postpone his Comic Lecture...being engaged in making many alterations therein.  The serious part will be consideredly shortened, some other pieces expunged, and many scenes of humour added, which he hopes will be entertaining.  He is extremely troubled that anything in his Lecture on Tuesday should have given offence to any one person present, and is no less concerned that those Ladies and Gentlemen who were desirous to hear him perform (that part which appeared exceptionable to others) were disappointed.  He is sorry there was any disaffection either way.  He is not conscious of having attempted anything with an intention to offend, or that has not already been allowed of inclusion though more unpardonable.  The foibles and peculations of private characters have been brought on the stage by others, those only of public men by him.  He hopes it will not appear vain or arrogant to say that after such unequaled peals of applause which he met with for some time while uninterrupted, it would be paying an ill compliment to so crowded and brilliant an audience not to flatter himself will possessing some degree of merit: And if he afterwards failed in any or every particular it was altogether owing (notwithstanding the seeming spirit he assumed) to the confusion he was in at the Party Affair which followed.  It was his first appearance in public, and in such a situation it is no wonder he was robb'd of his comic powers; but he hopes when his Lecture is alter'd there will be found in it nothing which can give offense, or deprive him of that generous indulgence to a young performer which characterizes a British audience.  [No further performance of the Lecture seems to have been given.]                                                                       *p˜ƒbfg Dramatic Turtle.

He would be very far from imposing upon the Inhabitants of this great Metropolis, and, unconscious of a Puff, he takes upon him to say that the Gay and Learned will find his Piece ornamented with a Festoon of Flowers gathered by an admitted Genius on the Banks of +Avon= and enriched with Wreaths twined by the Fingers of the Muses.  Here it may be said +Pomona=r has given the Apple Wit, in which every agreeable Flavour is combined, and $Bacchus=r has sent a Store of genuine Falernian from a Receipt which anciently belonged to $Homer=, and has lately been discovered with the Ruins of $Herculaneum=.

F.= of the +Middle Temple= wrote to Macklin suggesting two things to insure the success of the +Married Libertine=.  The first was practical, "bring in a claque of friends to counteract the noise of the Scots Lords who are opposing it."  The second was revisional: "The play is too long,--shorten it and give the house notice that you have so done.  The scenes wherein +Lady Belville=r is solemn, grave, complaining and moral may be much abbreviated; this will...take away that heavy, lazy and sleepy (however just) part which makes your friends languish and grow cold, and gives your enemies an opportunity to improve their rancor and malignity.  This observation may be applied to every recital, narrative or description which is not absolutely necessary or descriptive,--I mean necessarily connected with the frame, contexture & execution of the drama, or something designed or painted with uncommon poetic fire and enthusiasm.  Pray consider whether that serious, moral and sentimental part in the character of +Angelica=r might not be curtailed, or entirely omitted.  I would have your young captain fully employed in action without ever standing still to moralize or harangue, however sensibly and poignantly he may do it.  After all this there will remain a rich and uninterrupted vein of true comic humour and lively representation in short, a well connected series and succession of business which I am convinced would keep the audience so attentive and so entirely possessed that there would be no room for languor or malice to produce any effect to your detriment."

In short, here is the history of it.  You know the passion he always had for the +Italian comedy=.  About two years ago he writ one, intending to get it offered to $Rich=--but without his name--he would have died to be supposed an author, and writing [I, 372] for gain.  I kept this a most inviolable secret.  Judge then of my surprise when about a fortnight or three weeks ago I found my $Lord Melcomb= reading this very Bentleiad in a circle at my $Lady Hervey's=.  $Cumberland= had carried it to him, with a recommendatory copy of verses, containing more incense to the $King= and my $Lord Bute=, than the +Magi= brought in their portmanteaus to +Jerusalem=.  The idols were propitious, and to do them justice, there is a great deal of wit in the piece, which is called +The Wishes or Harlequin's Mouth Opened=.  A bank note of #200 was sent from the Treasury to the author, and the play ordered to be performed by the summer company.  $Foote= was summoned to Lord Melcomb's, where Parnassus was composed of the peer himself, who, like +Apollo= as I am going to tell you, was dozing, the two +Chief Justices= and Lord Bute.  $Bubo= read the play himself, with handkerchief and orange by his side.  But the curious part is a prologue which I never saw.  It represents the god of verse fast asleep by the side of +Helicon=r.  The race of modern bards try to wake him, but the more they repeat of their works, the louder he snores.  At last "Ruin seize thee ruthless King" is heard, and the god starts from his trance.  This is a good thought, but will offend the bards so much, that I think $Dr Bentley='s son will be abused at least as much as his father was.  The prologue concludes with young +Augustus=r, and how much he excels the ancient one, by the choice of his friend.  Foote refused to act this prologue, and said it was too strong. 'Indeed,' said Augustus's friend, 'I think it is.'  They have softened it a little, and I suppose it will be performed.  You may depend upon the truth of all this; but what is much more credible, is that the comely young author appears every night in the +Mall= in a milkwhite coat with a blue cape, disclaims any benefit, and says he has done with the play now it is out of his own hands, and that $Mrs Hannah Clio= alias Bentley writ the best scenes in it.  He is going to write a tragedy, and she, I suppose, is going--to court."--+Horace Walpole's Correspondence with George Montagu=.  Ed. $W. S. Lewis= and $Ralph S.

See 18 June and $Horace Walpole= to $George Montagu= [+Arlington Street=] July 28, 1761:  I came to town yesterday through clouds of dust to see +The Wishes=, and went ac- [I, 381] tually feeling for $Mr Bentley=, and full of the emotions he must be suffering.  What do [you] think in a house crowded was the first thing I saw!  $Mr and Madam Bentley= perked up in the front boxes and acting audience at his own play--no, all the impudence of false patriotism never came up to it!  Did one ever hear of an author that had couraee to see his own first night in public? I don't believe $Fielding= or $Foote= himself ever did--and this was the modest bashful Mr Bentley, that died at the thought of being known for an author, even by his own acquaintance!  In the stage-box was $Lady Bute=, $Lord Halifax= and $Lord Melcomb=-I must say the two last entertained the house as much as the play-your $King= was prompter, and called out to the actors every minute to speak louder-the other went backwards and forwards behind the scenes, fetched the actors into the box, and was busier than Harlequin.  The curious prologue was not spoken, the whole very ill-acted.  It turned out just what I remembered it, the good parts extremely good, the rest very flat and vulgar-the genteel dialogue I believe might be written by $Mrs Hannah=.  The audience was extremely fair.  The first act they bore with patience, though it promised very ill-the second is admirable and was much applauded-so was the third-the fourth woeful-the beginning of the fifth it seemed expiring, but was revived by a delightful burlesque of the ancient chorus-which was followed by two dismal scenes, at which people yawned-but were awakened on a sudden by Harlequin's being drawn up to a gibbet nobody knew why or wherefore-this raised a prodigious and continued hiss, Harlequin all the while suspended in the air-at last they were suffered to finish the play, but nobody attended to the conclusion-modesty and his lady all the while sat with the utmost indifference-I suppose Lord Melcombe had fallen asleep [p. 382] before he came to this scene and had never read it.  The epilogue was about the King and new $Queen=, and ended with a personal satire on $Garrick=-not very kind on his own stage-to add to the judge of this conduct, Cumberland two days ago published a pamphlet to abuse him.  It was given out for tonight with more claps than hisses, but I think it will not do unless they reduce it to three acts."  [p. 383].  +Correspondence with George Montagu=.  Ed. $W. S. Lewis= & $Ralph Brown=.  (+New Haven=: +Yale University= Press, 1941), I, 381-83]  Note: (I, 381n):  Bentley's play of +The Wishes or Harlequin's Mouth Opened=, was offered to Garrick and $Rich= the beginning of 1761, but wasrefused by both.  His nephew Cumberland showed it to Lord Melcomb, who carried it to Lord Bute, with a compliment in verse to that Lord by Mr Cumberland.  Lord Bute showed it to the King, who sent Bentley #200 and ordered the new summer company to play [it].  There was a prologue, flattering the King and Lord Bute which $Foote= refused to act.  Two days before it was played, Cumberland wrote an anonymous pamphlet, addressed to Mr Bentley, and abusing Garrick, who had refused to act Cumberland's tragedy of +Cicero=r's banishment, which he printed this year [1761], unacted.  The +Wishes= were played for the first time July 27th, 1761; the 2d 3d and part of the 4th, acts were much applauded, but the conclusion extremely hissed.  The +Epilogue= concluded with a satire on Garrick.  It was acted five nights.  About the same time he wrote a tragedy called +Philodamus=, which he was to read to Garrick, but the latter was so angry at their treatment of him, that he declared against seeing Mr Bentley" (MS account by HW of Bentley's writings, in the collection of $Lord Waldegrave= at +Chewton Priory=).  *p™Üdl The Wishes.

The Stage in the meantime, amidst the parading of Dukes, duchesses, archbishops, peeresses, heralds &c. was covered with a thick fog from the smoke of the fire, which served to hide the tawdry dresses of the processionalists.  During this idle piece of mockery, the actors, being exposed to the suffocations of smoke, and the raw air from the open street, were seized with colds, rheumatisms, and swelled faces.  At length the indignation of the audience delivered the comedians from this wretched badge of nightly slavery, which gained nothing to the managers but disgrace and empty benches.  Tired with the repeated insult of a show which had nothing to support it but gilt copper and old rags, they fairly drove the exhibitors of it from the stage by hooting and hissing, to the great joy of the whole theatre....Rich...fully satisfied [the publick's] warmest imaginations ($Davies=, +Life of Garrick=, I, 365 ff.).  *pšcg The Supspicious Husband.

As 22 Oct.  *d›¹dl II: +The Irish Lilt=, as 23 Oct.  *c›¹dl [PPuff for the afterpiece]: As this Pastoral was not originally designed for the theatre, it is thought proper to give the public some account of it, and by what means it has now found its way to the stage.  The Chorusses and Airs were selected from $Mr Handel=, and several other eminent masters, by a gentleman whose taste and knowledge in music is perhaps his least merit.  Having conceived the design of a musical entertainment of this miscellaneous nature he found himself oblig'd...to connect them [the airs] by a Recitative of his own composition: This naturally produced a kind of a little drama, and the ease and elegance of the whole is the more to be admired when it is considered that the words were of necessity composed in perfect subservience to the music.  The piece has been several times performed at +Salisbury= and greatly admired by many of the first Rank.  The author, upon $Mr Norris= being engaged at the theatre, was applied to for leave to bring it on the stage, to which he has most obligingly given his consent.  [Cast given]  After an agreeable Overture, the curtain rises and discovers a rural scene, and a troop of nymphs and shepherds assembled to celebrate the Spring.  Their rejoicings open with a grand cheerful chorus.  We cannot say enough of the taste and execution of $Mr Vernon= and $Miss Young= in this scene.  The united sprightliness and simplicity of the duet was truly admirable.  [Song given, followed by a brief description of the parting of the shepherds, the announcement of Peace so they won't have to part, and special commendation for the various songs of $Mr Vincent=, and Mr Norris.]  We will venture to prophesy that it will be more and more admired at every representation; though perhaps it may not fall in with the Taste of the Groundlings, who, like +Polonius=r, are for a +Jig or a Tale of Bawdry, or they sleep= (+Public Advertiser=).  *p›¹cg Every Man in His Humour.

The beauty as well as the propriety of the dresses give great satisfaction.  The Old +English Habits= are indeed admirably suited to the style and manners of the plays of that time, in which a peculiarity prevails very remote from modern dialogue and the present fashion.  The effect of this observation of the Costume, as the $French= call it, is very visible in the representation of +Every Man in His Humour=, and will, we hope, for the future be strictly observed in dressing every character of the plays of that age."

One thing the author of that letter has omitted, which, if possible is still more gross; and that is, in the course of Miss Poitier's hornpipe, one of her shoes happening to slipt down at the heel, she lifted up her leg, and danced upon the other till she had drawn it up.  This had she worn drawers, would have been the more excusable; but unhappily, there was little occasion for standing in the pit to see that she was not provided with so much as a fig-leaf.  The Court turned instantly from the stage-The Pit was astonished!  and scarcely anything, but a disapproving murmur, was heard, from the most unthinking spectator in the twelvepenny gallery."  Miss Poitier subsequently denied any impropriety in action, and sought hearing in the +Theatrical Review=.

See $Boswell='s account of his attendance that night with two friends,  With oaken cudgels in our hands and shrill sounding catcalls in our pockets," ready prepared to damn the play (+London Journal=), p. 154 ff.).]  +Critical Strictures on the New Tragedy of Elvira=, published this month (+Gentleman's Magazine=).  I then undressed for the Play.  My father and I went to the +Rose=, in the Passage of the Playhouse, where we found $Mallet=, with about thirty friends.  We dined together, and went from thence into the Pitt, where we took our places in a body, ready to silence all opposition.  However, we had no occasion to exert ourselves.  Not withstanding the malice of a party, Mallet's nation, connections and indeed imprudence, we heard nothing but applause.  I think it was deserved.  The play was borrowed from $de la Motte=, but the details and language have great merit.  A fine Vein of dramatick poetry runs thro' the piece.  The Scenes between the father and son awaken almost every sensation of the human breast; and the Council would have equally moved, but for the inconvenience unavoidable upon all Theatres, that of entrusting fine Speeches to indifferent Actors.  The perplexity of the Catastrophe is much, and I believe justly, critisized.  But another defect made a strong impression upon me.  When a Poet ventures upon the dreadful situation of a father who condemns his son to death; there is no medium; the father must either be monster or a Hero.  His obligations of justice, of the publick good, must be as binding, as apparent as perhaps those of the first +Brutus=r.  The cruel necessity consecrates his actions, and leaves no room for repentance.  The thought is shocking, if not carried into action.  In the execution of Brutus's sons I am sensible of that fatal necessity.  Without such an example, the unsettled liberty of +Rome=v would have perished the instant after its birth.  But +Alonzo=r might have pardoned his son for a rash attempt, the cause of which was a private injury, and whose consequences could never have disturbed an established government.  He might have pardoned such a crime in any other subject; and the laws could exact only a equal rigor for a son; a Vain appetite for glory, and a mad affectation of Heroism, could only influence him to exert an unequal & superior severity (+Gibbon's Journal=, ed. $D.

See +Gentleman's Magazine=, Feb. 1763, +Historical Chronicle=, Th. 24: A riot happened at +Covent Garden theatre= occasioned by a demand being made for full prices at the opera +Artaxerxes=.  The mischief done was the greatest ever known on any occasion of the like kind; all the benches of the boxes and Pit being entirely tore up, the glasses and chandeliers broken, and the linings of the Boxes cut to pieces.  The rashness of the rioters was so great, that they cut aWay the wooden pillars between the Boxes, so that if the inside of them had not been iron, they would have brought down the Galleries upon their heads.  The damages done amount to at least #2000.  Four persons concern'd in the riot have been committed to the gatehouse.  +The Beauties of All Magazines Selected=, for March 1763 (p. 142) reprinted from the +Ledger= a humorous account of this riot as told by a sailor in fabricated seaman's language:  As soon as the foresheet was clewed up...As to my 5s., why the owners are welcome to it towards repair, for you stripp'd plank, timbers, and scantlings,-you gutted her; she look'd like a French prize, after a yard-arm engagement."]  *pœ9cg Occasional Oratorio.  [Cancelled.%  *cœ9cg [TThe following notice appeared in the +Public Advertiser=]: Whereas a very unjustifiable disturbance happened last night at this theatre; the managers think it incumbent upon them to acquaint the Publick that when the Opera of +Artaxerxes= was in rehearsal it was determined that no expence should be spared to render the performance as elegant as the nature of so peculiar an Entertainment would admit.  This desire occasioned so considerable an increase of the nightly charge  'twas thought by many disinterested persons would justify additional prices; but to avoid giving the least umbrage, and in gratitude for the Public indulgence on other occasions, no such advance was attempted.  When it is known that the extraordinary nightly expence attending this performance amounts to upwards of Fifty Pounds it is humbly apprehended no persons of justice and candour will think the Full Price an exorbitant gratification for such unusual disbursements.  The Management therefore flatter themselves that a resolution to oppose the arbitrary and illegal demands of a particular set of persons, contrary to the general sense of audience, will not be deemed arrogant or unreasonable, especially when those demands are enforced by means subversive to Private Property, and in violation of that decorum which is due to all public assemblies.  *pœ:dl The Discovery.

His excuse was that he was merely manager for other proprietors, and that property interest was involved in the financial sacrifice he was asked to make.  He noted further reasons for not immediately giving in to demands of the rioters:  Mr Beard had at that time received several anonymous threatening letters and notes concerning many other branches of what they called Reformation.  He was ordered by one to add a farce to +Love in a Village=, or the House should be pulled about his ears.  By andther he was commanded to put a stop to the farther representation of that Opera, upon the penalty of enforcing his compliance by a Riot the next night of performance, and very lately received certain information of meetings, which have already been held, and an Association forming to reduce the prices at the Theatre to what they were forty years since, tho' it is notorious the Expence of Theatrical Entertainments are more than doubled.  For these reasons he looked upon the Occasion of the present disturbance only as a prelude to future violence; as the first not the last salutation of this extraordinary kind to be expected, and apprehended that too easy an acquiescence might possibly prove rather encouragement than prevention.  Nevertheless in gratitude for the many favours and indulgencies received from the Publick, and from an earnest desire to promote that order and decorum so essential in all Public Assemblies, the Proprietors have now jointly authorized Mr Beard to declare that they shall think themselves equally bound with the managers of the other Theatre to an observance of those limitations which they have agreed to."

By $Sir James Jay, M. D=. (+London=, 1771).  The funds collected seem largely to have been used up in a law suit.  The Governor of the $College of New York=, $Rev. Dr Johnson=, asked Jay to collect funds, which he did.  $Alderman Trecothick= wrote $Dr Johnson= that the funds were not safe in Jay's hands.  The Governors insulted Jay, and when they found they were wrong refused to apologize.  They entered a bill against him in Chancery to gain the funds.  It dragged out for four years.  When the power of Attorney had been given to Trecothick, he claimed that a sum of #1437 15s. 6d. was unaccounted for by Jay, and was supposed to be in Jay's hands.

Whilst this sheet was at press, I was told that Mr Arne has reduc'd this opera into one act, and set the whole anew; and so managed matters, that Rosamond appears throughout the whole drama.
