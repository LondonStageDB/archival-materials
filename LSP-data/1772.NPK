Miss Bradley's performance of Lucy with great spirit, vivacity and Propriety' and her singing being so well suited to the character, she so much eclipsed Polly, that the audience formed a more indifferent opinion of her abilities than she deserved."]  Receipts: #220 11s. 6d.

I went with a party into the Gallery to see the event as there was a great riot expected, & indeed never did I see an audience more inflamed.  They would not suffer them to begin the piece.  At last $Mr King= came on with a written paper in his hand, which he said he was desir'd to read in the name of the managers.  After a great noise they let him read it.  He said just before the play began the managers had receiv'd a letter from Mr Dibdin in which he declared that Bickerstaff was not the author of that piece, that he had made oath of it, and was ready to do the same again, but that for very particular reasons the author could not be given up.  Then they stopp'd him & roar'd out that the author should be given up then.  He continued as loud as he possibly could, reading on that 'but that if Mr Dibdin did not very soon given up the author he never should be suffered to appear again on that stage or any other.'  Very luckily that turn'd them as I believe the House would have come down.  The piece then began.  Before the end of the first act one of $Bannister='s songs were encor'd.  The other party were against it and would not let it go on.  They all stood up and insisted that the author should be known then.  After some time the house being nothing but confusion, Dibdin was push'd upon the stage ready to drop with fright, and declared that he was the author himself.  Then they were as noisy the other way.  Made them finish the piece, but how you may guess in a storm.  It is like the +Padlock=, but the songs not so good."

In vain did $Bensley= endeavor frequently to speak and tell them that Colman was not to be found.  The still continued hissing and roaring, and this last till past seven o'clock.  $Dagge= and $Harris= were behind in a dreadful consternation least the house should be demolished, of which indeed it was in some danger.  At last they said something must be said to quiet them, when Smith in the confusion ran on and told them that the managers had consented Mrs Yates should play for him.  Then they sent him off to tell them that his day must be settled whenever he thought proper, to give her time to come here.  He went off and made them fix it for the 19th of April, went on and told them it was settled.  They then insisted that Smith should tell them whether everything was settled to his entire satisfaction.  He assured them it was.  The play was then ordered to begin.  I am told they have given him up his articles for three years, at his desire.  Several Gentlemen went round into the Hall and sent for Smith, telling him his private quarrels with the managers were nothing to them.  That if Mrs Yates play'd they should be glad to see her, but that as she was not in the company it was not right in him to disturb the play and hinder them from seeing it.  He expostulated with them and told his story.  The Town rings with this affair.  Various are the opinions.  Some think it is her plan to get once more upon the stage, and they say there is a most powerful Party making to oppose her & that she shall not play that night.  Others say Colman is very wrong to hinder her.  I find she entirely built upon your playing for me, and there has been a very impatient card in the +Ledger= to Colman insisting upon his telling the town why Mrs Yates was hindered to play, and why $Mr Macklin= had any more right to be suffered to come over so long unmolested to play for Miss Macklin?  But that everybody sees thru'....Colman I am certain has not a thing against your playing for me.  He seems rather to wish for your coming....I do not think the $Yeats='s will be engag'd tho' the Town rail much at $Mrs Hartley= & $Miss Miller=, and sure enough they are bitter bad....On Tuesday I shall send you the fate of $Dr Goldsmith='s Comedy, which comes out on Monday next.  It is call'd the +Mistakes of a Night=....$Foote='s +Rary Shew= has been rehears'd three mornings but he got no money, so he shews off again at night instead-but it does not fill violently.  +Alonzo= goes on but $Barry= is too ill to play.

The old +Roman comedy=, as it was called, was designed for nobler purposes: it was directed to improve the head and mend the heart.  The keen manly satire of that Comedy was pointed at Upstart, Braggart, Vice, and to expose the dangerous unfeeling craft of innocent Villainy, or to use the words of $Mr Pope=--Brand the bold front of shameless, guilty man.  Such was, and such ought to be, the salutary Direction of Wit, and Satire by exhibiting characters in their genuine colours, when the mask, which disguises and conceals them from the eyes of the Weak the Credulous, and the Ignorant, is drawn off.

In a long article on "Stage Effect, or Dramatic Cookery," it concluded that our "Theatrical managers and even our Theatrical Critics seem to have resolved all the merit of dramatic composition into stage trick, and rest their criterion of Dramatic Genius on the knowledge of what they are pleased to call Stage effect."  The "Theatre" article for the month remarked upon the boldness of Garrick's opening with the +Beggar's Opera=, "notwithstanding he was requested by the +Bench of Justices= at +Bow-Street=, to suppress it, as they were of opinion it had done a great deal of mischief among the low class of people."  +Lloyd's Evening Post=, 17 Sept., included extracts from letters against playing the +Beggar's Opera=, "because every performance makes from one two twenty thieves."  $Sir John Fielding= and his associates had addressed a letter to Garrick requesting him not to perform the opera for the same reason.  The +Morning Chronicle=, 23 Sept., praised Garrick for not complying with the Justices' request.  $Wm Augustus Miles= published a +Letter to Sir John Fielding= occasioned by his extraordinary Request to $Mr Garrick= for the suppression of the Beggar's Opera (44 pp.).  In this he vindicated the moral effect of the opera.]  Receipts: #158 (Treasurer's Book).

Mainpiece: With New Dresses and Decorations.  [The first of a series of five performances (the last, +Merchant of Venice=, 18 Nov.) which got Macklin dismissed from the theatre until 1775, when his lawsuit against six persons whom he claimed formed a conspiracy to hiss him from the stage and ruin his livlihood was concluded favorably for him.  His performance of +Macbeth= was favorably treated but with certain misgivings in the +Morning Chronicle= (25 Oct.), but he was mercilessly criticized in the +London Evening Post= and +St James Chronicle=: "In Act II, Sc. i, $Shakespeare= has made Macbeth murder +Duncan=r; Now Mr $Macklin=, being determined to copy from no man, reversed this incident, and in the very first act, scene the second, murdered +Macbeth=r."  The favorable review (Morning Chronicle) thought he did well in first and last acts, but gave way to stage rant and "vehemence of energetic expression" wanting any variation in tone in between.  It also pointed out a certain faulty memory of his lines.  His novel stage effects came in for a paragraph of comment:  The alterations in the jeux de theatre respecting the representation of this tragedy do Mr Macklin great credit.  His change of the scenery is peculiarly characteristical.  The Quadrangle of Macbeth's castle, and the door which is supposed to lead to Duncan's apartment (both of which are entirely new) are additions of consequence to the exhibition of the play.  The door also through which Macbeth comes to the +Weird Sisters=r, in the 4th act, is a better and more probable entrance than through the common stage portal.  The dresses are new, elegant, and of a sort hitherto unknown to a +London= audience, but exceedingly proper.  The Banquet was superbly set out, and it must be confessed that the managers seem to have spared neither cost nor assiduity to ornament and add to the effect of the representation."  A favorable letter from a correspondent to the London Evening Post adds: "I must observe, Mr Printer, that from the graceful and characteristic manner in which Macbeth was introduced by the martial music and military procession, from the manner of M. Macklin's acting, from his judicious alteration of the dresses, the disposition of the scene where the King is killed, the cave of the witches in the 4th act, from the improvement of $Mrs Hartley='s thinking in +Lady Macbeth=r and from her manner of speaking, which seemed plainly to be the effects of some intelligence she had received from Mr Macklin...I thought Mr Macklin deserv'd great praise."  See the newspaper comments all gathered and reprinted in an +Apology for the Conduct of Charles Macklin=, (London, 1773).  See also note to 30 Oct.  See also +London Chronicle=, Oct. 23-26 (cf. $Odell=, I, 453).  The +Westminster Magazine= suggests the performance was pitiable.  "Macklin knew what he ought to do, but could not do it."  The Scenemen's pay this week was about double the normal cost.  (Account Book).]  Verse Squibs from St James Chronicle (Oct. 1773) against Macklin: @Macbeth@"Eight Kings appear and pass over in order, and Banquo the last"@Old $Quin=, ere Fate suppressed his lab'ring breath@In studied accents grumbled out Macbeth:--@Next $Garrick= came, whose utt'rance truth impressed,@While ev'ry look the tyrant's guilt confess'd:--@Then the cold $Sheridan= half froze the part,@Yet what he lost by nature sav'd by art.@Tall $Barry= now advanc'd toward +Birnam Wood=v@Nor ill performed the scenes--he understood--@Grave $Mossop= next to +Foris=r shaped his march@His words were minute guns, his action starch.@Rough $Holland= too--but pass his errors o'er@Nor blame the actor when the man's no more.@Then heavy $Ross=, assay'd the tragic frown,@But beef and pudding kept all meaning down:--@Next careless $Smith=, try'd on the Murd'rer's mask,@While o'er his tongue light tripp'd the hurried task:--@Hard $Macklin=, late, guilt's feelings strove to speak,@While sweats infernal drench'd his iron cheek;@Like $Fielding='s Kings [in +Tom Thumb=] his fancy'd triumphs past,@And all be boasts is, that he falls the last.@  Also from St James Chronicle:@+The Witches=r, while living deluded Macbeth@And the Devil laid hold of his soul after death;@But to punish the Tyrant this would not content him,@So Macklin he sent on the stage to present him.@  *pking's Comment.  *cThe proprietors of the +Opera House= think it is their duty to lay before the Nobility and Gentry to whose patronage they are highly endebted a list of the engagements made for the ensuing season.

This night was aparently, except for #4 5s. which was not recorded on the books of the theatre until 18 June well after the season closed.  Macklin's suit in court against the rioters was judged 24 Feb. 1775.  A column and a half account of the trial appeared in the +Public Advertiser=, Saturday 13 May 1775, giving the testimony of the witnesses accused of starting the riot, the lawyers, and the judge.  The accused were $Leigh=, $Miles=, $James=, $Aldus=, and $Clarke=.  The first four were convicted of a conspiracy and a riot, the last of a riot only.  During the Course of the Business $Lord Mansfield= took Occasion to observe, that the Right of Hissing, and Applauding in a theatre was an unalterable Right, but there was a wide Distinction between expressing the natural Sensations of the Mind as they arose on what was seen and heard, and executing a pre-concerted Desagn, not only to hiss an Actor when he was playing a Part in which he was universally allowed to be excellent, but also to drive him from the theatre, and effect his utter ruin."

Kenrick accounts for the failure in his Preface to the 1773 edition by reference to the Macklin affair (See 23 Oct., 30 Oct. and 18 Nov.)  He quotes from the +Public Advertiser= (22 Nov.): "On Saturday last a new comedy called the +Duellist= was performed, for the first time, at +Covent Garden Theatre=.  Previous to the curtain being drawn up, the following written handbill was dispersed about the house.  '$Mr Macklin= has been pursued by a malicious party to such a pitch of rancour, that at last they have succeeded so far in their cursed designs, as to get him discharged this theatre, and thereby have deprived him of the means of a livelihood; therefore if the public have any spirit, they will not suffer the new play to begin till $Mr Colman= promises that Mr Macklin shall be engaged again.'  This handbill found its way into the green-room, and had a very visible effect on the performers, as was plainly evident from their confusion.  The piece was received with great marks of approbation, and given out again for Monday, which was attended with some hissing, but that was greatly overpowered by the general applause of the audience.  The overture to +Thomas and Sally= being attended to with silence, the greatest part of the author's friends quitted the theatre; which being taken advantage of by a party in the gallery, a riot ensued, and the entertainment was not suffered to go on till another play was given out for Monday."  Kenrick agrees with this account, then analyses several other objections which he dismisses, to wit, in the play (a) too lengthy a satire on lawyers, (b) an indelicate passage in +Latin= (omitted from the printed version); in the audience, a conspiracy of $Garrick= and $Bickerstaffe= against him; and lack of a claque of his own friends to carry through their suport of him.

[The +Public Advertiser= carried a two-column account of +Sethona=, telling the story of the play act by act.  It concluded:  Such is the Story of this new Tragedy which was received with universal Applause by a crowded and brilliant Audience and seems to bid fair to become a Stock Play.  The Parts were judiciously cast, and the Performers did great Justice to their respective Characters.  Perhaps $Mrs Barry= never appeared in a greater or more amiable Point of View than on Saturday Night.  In short her Performance beggared Description; and it is impossible to form an adequate Idea of her Merit in +Sethona=r without seeing her.  $Mr Barry= was also very great in the +Old Hermit=r, and exhibited as pathetic and as chaste a piece of acting as we remember to have seen.  The Dresses, Decorations and Scenery of this Play are much superior to those of any modern Tragedy; they do ample Justice to the Author, and likewise do Honour to the Taste and Spirit of the Manager, who seems to have spared no Expence to furnish a splendid and rational Entertainment.  The Scene of the Temple of +Osiris=r, and the View of the +Egyptian Catacombs=v were particularly admired, and are worthy of the Brush of $Mr Loutherbourg=.  The +Prologue= is a very classical Performance, and was well delivered by $Mr Reddish=, notwithstanding the noise and the frequent Interruption usual on these occasions.  The +Epilogue= in the character of an +Egyptian Fortune Teller=r was admirably spoken by Mrs Barry, and had an amazing effect.  It contains some excellent Strokes of Satire on the Times and a rich vein of Humour which is finely sustained throughout.  From several Circumstances we should suppose this Epilogue to be the Production of our +English Roscius= and it seems to be one of his best."]  Receipts: #226 15s.

His figure is at present lank, awkward, and unengaging; his voice distinctly powerful, but inharmonious; his action outre, vulgar and forced: his attitudes unnatural, affected and disgustful; and his delivery a continued rant, without proper change, a pleasing variety, or a just discrimination of the necessary difference of tone demanded by the different passions.  These...capital defects...are not unsurmountable...The play was prefaced by a new +Prologue=, evidently the production of Mr Garrick.  It had some humor and was well received.  The purport of it was to beg favor for the hero of the evening, whom it compared to a young swimmer, who had tried to float in two shallow streams, and was now about to venture himself in the great deep.

After a dance of +Cupids=r, +Hymen=r, &c....offering them eternal wreaths, the +Druid of the Oaks=r, freed by the present powers of Beauty from that sequestered habitation to which by mystic spells he had long been doomed, appears to ratify their union, and astonishes the spectators by his magic influence, in a glorious vision of that felicity the virtues of the happy pair had so justly insured.  An admirable vaudeville, and a grand dance, conclude the dramatic entertainment....Had it not appeared obvious that the whole was intended as a mere vehicle for the splendid spectacle, we do not suppose, in spite of the managers Orders and Puffs, that the author's labors would have been tolerated.  The very excellent scenery, however, of the ingenious Mr Loutherbourg preserved this piece from that damnation, which as a dramatic production, it justly merited."]  Receipts: #263 14s. 6d.

Their prices of admission have been raised within these thirty years, and every art practised for interest of the managers; and in these times, when every necessary and convenience of life is considerably enhanced, it is a matter of prudence in persons of the middle rank of life to prefer the gallery to the pit.  But this is no reason why livery servants should be allowed to place themselves by the wives and daughters of private gentlemen and reputable tradesmen, to whom they often behave with great insolence and indecency.

He blames his inexperience and want of judgment in theatrical effects, the extreme length of the play act by act, and haste in writing.  From the +Westminster Magazine= Feb., which outlined the plot in five columns:  The present state of the Rivals is widely different from that in which we found it on the first night's representation.  +Sir Lucius O'Trigger=r being re-touched, has now the appearance of a character; and his assigning +Beverley=r's reflection on his country as the grounds for his desire to quarrel with him, is a reasonable pretence, and wipes off the former stigma undeservedly thrown on the sister Kingdom.  An alteration of a principal incident gave a very favorable turn to the fable and the whole piece: that where young +Acres=r now delivers his challenge to his friend +Absolute=r, begging him to carry it to his Rival Beverly, not knowing the two characters composed but one man; its being at first given to Sir Lucius, the person who indited it, was highly inconsistent...we should be induced from many evident traits of literary genius to pronounce the +Rivals= a good comedy."]  *pking's Armida.

The Fable, indeed, is too light and trival to endure the severity of a critical analysis; but it is at least sufficiently important to serve as a vehicle for the music; and the catastrophe has peculiar vivacity and theatrical spirit.  Upon the whole the author has fully answered the end he proposed of introducing a deserving young composer whose name, it seems is Carter, to the public and who more than promises to be a composer of taste and genius.  In this his first performance he both received and deserved the greatest encouragement and applause.  $Mr Weston= spoke a humorous +Epilogue= accompanied by a large dog named $Dragon=, which had a very good effect, but as it was poor Dragon's first time of appearing on the stage, he, like all young performers of true feeling, seemed a good deal frightened...but having conquored his fears, and recovered himself a little, he performed his part very chastely and to the entire satisfaction of all present."  +Epilogue= ends with a satirical remark upon $Sg Rossignol=, the "bird imitator" at +Covent Garden=.

[This play had been refused a license on 26 March 1739, While $Walpole= was still Prime Minister, probably because of such speeches as: @Is there a cure on Humankind so fell@So pestilent, to Prince and People,@As the base servile vermin of a court;@Corrupt, Corrupting ministers and favourites?@How oft have such eat up the widow's morsel,@The Peasant's toil, the Merchant's far-sought gain,@And wantoned to the ruin of a nation!-+Larpent MS=, op. p. 65.@  Also the play equalizes $Christianity= and $Mohammedanism= before $God=, and gives a slight edge to the latter (Act IV, scene ii), suggesting the part politics play in +Christian churches=.

In Judging the popularity of a play in terms of box receipts for this season one must be aware of the fact that the treasurer's account books here differ from those of the five preceding years in not recording the income from the tickets delivered out for benefit nights.  Hence on those nights the stated income reflects only the money taken at the door the night of the performance, and does not indicate the larger amounts which the actors received for their tickets.

It cannot be a matter of surprise that +Roscius= should have escaped the infection and his spirits and constitution seems proof against the attacks of age itself; after above 30 campaigns, his ardour and execution appear rather to increase.  Benedict owes all its consequence to his attachment; there is a peculiar turn of humour in this soldier that none but Mr Garrick has ever been able to enter into the true spirit of.  Last night he supported the character with undiminished excellence, and in the speech where he meditates and then resolves on marriage, he soared beyond himself.

[$MacMillan='s note from $Kemble= differs slightly, mentioning $Bickerstaff= as the author.  +Larpent MS 397= contains elaborate stage direction at opening: "An interior apartment in the Seraglio.  An arch in the middle of the back scene, which is shut with a curtian.  On the right hand toward the front is a sopha in the +Turkish manner=, low deep, and long, covered with carpets and cushions.  A little gold table about eight inches high and a foot and a half square.  Upon it a rich or gold saver set with jewels, with two cups on porcelain, and a spoon made of the beak of an +Indian bird=, which is redder than coral, extremely rare and of extensive price."  This may have been intended for a reading audience.  In the piece Mrs Abington, an +English slave=r , rebels in the confines of the Seraglio, and start a reform movement wherein men are to please the women.  Concludes with demostration of the nobility of +English women= who will not be enslaved, who will not flatter, who will preserve their liberty and dignity, and who are capable of returning love for honor and respect.  Reviewed in +Westminster Magazine= for Dec.: "The Audience appeared to be divided in their opinion of the merit of the +Sultan=, some loudly applauding, and others as loudly condemning it, when the curtain dropped.  The Majority however, stood firmly for it, and a verdict was returned in its favor.  The managers not only well dressed this dramatic trifle, but bestowed three new scenes on it: The Outer Gate of the Seraglio--An Interior view of it--and a Garden terminating in a prospect of the sea.  The first was but la! la!  The last two were beautiful and picturesque.

[This note appeared on all subsequent bills advertising the +Jubilee= this season.]  The most accomplished actress can display little other abilities in this part [Portia] than a correct elocution, and a knowledge of the author.  The lady of last night being thus circumstanced [her first appearance] it is impossible to pronounce what the nature or extent of her powers may enable her to execute when placed in a situation that calls them forth.  But from the speciman she gave there is not room to expect anything beyond mediocrity.  Her figure and face, although agreeable, have nothing striking, her voice (that requisite of all public speakers) is far from being favourable to her progress as an actress.  It is feared she possess a monotone not to be got rid of; there is also vulgarity in her tones, ill calculated to sustain that line in a theatre she has at first been held forth in; but as these observations are formed when the lady laboured under the disadvantages of a first attempt in the metropolis, her future efforts may perhaps entirely remove them (+Middlesex Journal=, 30 Dec.

Review of Webster's acting appeared in the +Westminster Magazine= for Jan.: "His person is rather elegant; his voice is full and harmonious, his pronunciation distinct and correct, and his delivery graceful and unembarassed.  Those are his excellencies, and considering it was his first performance, he seems to possess them in a degree far superior to the various candidates for theatrical fame which the managers of both houses have brought forward for some years past.  On the other hand he is aukward, and in some parts unanimated.  His arms are too long, or he flung them about in a very disgusting manner.  He seemed to express the sense of his author much better than his own feelings.  His voice though full, wants variety and modulation; not but on some occasions he managed it with infinite grace and judgement.  But if this want of variety of tones and extent of voice, which is so indispensibly necessary to constitute a first rate actor, be not the effect of Nature, the Public may behold with less anxiety their decayed veterans giving nightly proofs of their increasing infirmities, and quick approaching theatrical dissolution."]  *p16 dl The Fair Penitent.

Here the Passage to the first Door was too full for me to entertain any Hopes of getting in that Way, we therefore made for +Catharine-street= but the Multitudes of People waiting for the Opening of the Gallery-doors, rendered it impossible for us to get along through the Court; we therefore made a Circuit, and at length arrived opposite the Door in Catharine-street, where it was with Difficulty we could keep our Stands on a Foot Pavement....You will be absolutely inexcusable, if after this Warning you neglect to adopt some Method for the Security of the Lives of his Majesties Subjects on similar Occasions.--What think you of the following Scheme, viz.  To keep the outer Doors next the Street shut, till the inner ones are opened ; and then, by a Proper bar, to prevent more than one at a Time entering, who shall there pay Entrance-money, and receive the Tickets of Admission through the inner Doors' (+Public Advertiser= 18 May).]  Receipts: #308 1s.

[$MacMillan='s note from $Kemble= differs slightly.]  [A full column letter for the +Morning Chronicle= this date from $Theatricus= to Garrick protested the fact that his announced benefit for the +Theatrical Fund= on the 30th of May would be all sold out to the highest bidders for tickets; that a nobleman offering ten Guineas for four box seats would get them in preference to the tradesmen who offered only a pound, the stated price of the tickets.  Since charity was the cause this writer suggested that Garrick give a second benefit night to the Fund, with the hopes (1) that the Fund would be thereby vastly increased, and (2) that opportunity might be given for twice as many People to see a Garrick final performance.  It was, perhaps, in response to this public request that Garrick gave a second Benefit night for the Fund on 10 June.  The +Morning Post=,  29 May, noted: "The concourse of servants assembled yesterday morning at seven o'clock, at +Drury Lane= Stage Door, to take places for the approaching benefit, in which it is said $Mr Garrick= will again play +Richard III=r , was astonishing, amounting to many hundreds, three fourths of which were not able to Succeed in their embassies' (+Hampden, Journal=).]  Receipts: #307 3s. 6d.

As 5 Oct.  *c°¯dl [AAs afterpiece +Public Advertiser= announces +The Rival Candidates=, but see +Hopkins Diary=, 12 Oct.]  The Managers met again to-day, but nothing settled.  +Hamlet= was given out.  I saw $Mr Sheridan=, he told me that $Mr Lacy= and he had agreed that no Play should be given out, nor any Bills put up, till they had settled this Affair, which was to be done to-Morrow at $Mr Wallis='s (the Attorney's) where they were all to dine.  I waited on Mr Lacy, who agreed to the same, and no Bills or Paragraph were sent to the Papers.  All the Business of the Theatre is at a Stand, and no Rehearsal called.  Wed. 16th--Mr Sheridan, $Dr Ford= and $Mr Linley= dined today by Appointment with Mr Wallis where Mr Lacy was to have met them; about four o'clock he sent a verbal Message that he could not come to Dinner, but would wait upon them in the Evening, and about nine o'clock he came, and everything was settled to the Satisfaction (of them all) and a Paragraph sent to the Papers, and the +Hypocrite= and +Christmas Tale= was advertised for Friday, but no Play was to be done on Thursday--+Covent Garden= did not play on Friday (Hopkins Diary).  +Public Advertiser=, 16 Oct., summarizes the proprietors' dispute: the +Drury Lane= patent had been purchased [in 1747] by $David Garrick= and $James Lacy=.  On his death Lacy had devised his half-share to his son, $Willoughby Lacy=; on his retirement from the stage Garrick had sold his half-share to Sheridan, Ford and Linley.  The original agreement between Garrick and Lacy, as recited in a document retained by the attorney $Albany Wallis= was that, in case of the sale of either share of the patent, or any part of either share, the seller was obligated to offer the first refusal to purchase to the other partner, and that this was to be done only when the theatre was closed for the summer.  In selling one half of his share to $Robert Langford= and to $Edward Thompson=, Willoughby Lacy was--so argued his three partners--acting illegally: he had not offered to them the first refusal, and he was negotiating the sale at a time when the theatre was open.  +Public Advertiser=, 17 Oct.. prints a statement from Lacy saying that he did not feel himself bound by the original agreement between his father and Garrick, but that, in the interest of the business of the theatre, he had asked Langford and Thompson to withdraw their claim to partnership, to which request they had acceded.
